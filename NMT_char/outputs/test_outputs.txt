You know that what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, the more I read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can dress up as a farmer, or leather clothes, and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk about circles and epidemics.
And you know that an epiphany usually is something that you fall out somewhere.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as an epidemic.
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bolibia.
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the '60s in middle school, in State, Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When they were beaten to bleed every week in the bathroom of kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by allowing me to enter the professor of the professor room.
He did it in secret.
For three years.
I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and ended up in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the '80s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that fought AIDS against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, in the middle of the night I got a phone call from that teacher, Mr. Position he said, "I need to see.
I'm discovering that of adults we never get to know us.
You could come to Ohio and please bring that man who I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to take you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland, we were at Clarine.
We went to see it, we laughed up, we cry, and we realized she needed to be hospitalizing.
We found a place, we tried, and we looked at it, and we looked at his family, because it was necessary.
So we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to know as adults came to meet me, he became a corner of cents, and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed up, he had become a circle -- and that epidemic that I told them was made in its own.
The epidemic is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved her from.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
I need truth and beauty, and I'm very happy today to talk about this.
It needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and there I saw my first temperatures.
I was amazing.
My heart happy happy, I was married, trying to understand what was in front of me.
The temperatures around me rose out of the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't think that it was a snow glass on another snow of snow year after year.
The magnets are born when they get away from the glaciers or they break the ice bar.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them will refuse to reach and spread up to the end, whereas others can't support it more and fall into a dramatic passion arrangement.
It's easy to think, when you see an iceberg who are separated and alone, largely as we see us sometimes as humans.
But reality is all the opposite.
As an iceberg is dead, I'm breathing his ancestral atmosphere.
As a iceberg releases water releases in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I am close to photograph these temperatures as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are just that way and they won't be able to exist that way again.
It's not death when they're deadly, it's not an end, but a continuation of its way by the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the temperatures that I photograph is very young -- it has a couple thousand years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you is a picture that I photographed at Kestary, Greenland.
It's a little bit often really often to come to press a surrounding phenomenon.
Here they are.
You can see the left a little boat.
It measures about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your floating line.
You can see here, it starts rolling up, the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a Greenland iceberg of the average size.
Take out of the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so you know, the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every one of a little baby, OK.
So, two couples each.
I don't want you to stop too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about concepts in itself, you're not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined to the X chromosome of the egg.
And in the other case, the X chromosome of sperm is joined to the X chromosome of the egg.
Both of them come and start life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity it tends to make two roles.
In one of my roles I work with the history of anatomy.
I am a statement of training, and what I study in this case is the way people tackle the anatomy -- I mean, of human bodies and animals, how they consider body flow, the idea of the body, what have you thought about the body.
The other role that I play in my work is activist, as a patient designer, or, as I say sometimes an impact of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working for example, for example, simple twins, two people inside the same body.
I've worked with people with engineering, people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of attentional sex, individuals whose physical technology doesn't fit in the male sculptures and conventional female companies.
In general, we can call it international.
The intensity adopted many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that is not excited in the forms of male or female communities.
For example, there's the case of the individual with X-ray criminal base whose genes of the chromosome -- and he tells the professors, that we all have in the fatal life, which becomes television.
And then, in film life, telescopes produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks of testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the syndrome of insect to the angles.
So there are high levels of testosterone, but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body is developed by a typical female course.
When the baby is born, the baby is kind of a child.
It's a girl. It's raised as a child.
And it's often not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the senses, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
After making it tests realize that instead of having an ovarian and the uterus -- it actually has testicles and a chromosome Y.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, like men, have in the body called super-immersion glaciers.
They're in the back of the body.
Superintelligent glands produce angles, the hormone hormone.
Most women like me consider a typical woman -- it doesn't know their chromosomes structure, I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to anger.
We produce angles and respond to the animations.
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the animals that the woman was born with telescopes that have the syndrome of insect to the angles.
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that the aliens are in the middle of the spectrum, in some ways they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I received a call from a 19-year-old boy born and raised as they would go. I had girlfriend, and sexual relations with her, carried a life as a boy and just discovered that he had an old and broken.
He had a extreme way of a disease known as a super-immersive hyperactive hyperbolic.
He had 20th chromosomes and in the uterus the supernormal glands were so active that, essentially, they created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genius were manufacturing, their brain was exposed to typically male component.
I was born with a child, no one suspected anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal menus, when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was woman inside.
Well, another quick example of an intersection case.
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what is known as an obese, which is to say, they have a reverse tissue in tissue tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it's anonymous, simple twins, or international, are subjected to normal surgery is not to be able to get better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason they are subjected to various surgeries is that they're a threat for our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings apart a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have female identity, supposedly being black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, you have trouble with categories.
So we have very romantic ideas in our culture to the individual.
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept of individual.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children are born like two people in the same body.
The last recent case was last year with South African Carloon Carl set up in a trial of judgment his sex at Berlin International Googles.
A lot of reporters called to ask me, "What are you going to do to determine whether Carl Sends is man or woman?
And I had to explain to the journalists that there isn't such a test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we need to admit that nature doesn't bring a little bit of a love line between men and women or between men and international and international women -- are us who we take that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were static anatomic categories that correspond directly with stable categories -- are much more difficult than we thought.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race -- something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology allows you.
As we see, we get into a scary terrain.
So look, for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What are we going to take out of them in just a few nucleares?
And as we program in science we get more and more in an uncomfortable zone where we need to recognize that the simplistic categories that we manage are probably too simplistic.
And we're looking at this in all aspects of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning of life.
It's hard to look at a moment from which a body gets human and has different rights to the photos.
There are very tight discussions today -- maybe not in public, but I do know within the medicine.
Our ancestors never had to come up with this question of whether someone was dead.
As many of you put a pen in front of your nose, and if you moved you still didn't get it.
If I stopped moving it up.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs of a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we need to face the dilemma to really determine someone's death, and this puts us into a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could get someone like me.
In politics I'm a predator, I define people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I get nervous.
It will make sure that these categories are much more unstable than we think we thought about it.
It tends to be from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first of all, I have to admit that I'm a fermental private of the Fords Foundation.
I know they were racist -- I know they were sexuality, but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and auditorium and so radical in what they did -- that I find each so much watching that music curved 1779, and not by music, which is totally passenger.
It's because of what happened in 1776 with the Fords Foundation.
The Foundation fathers were to me, for me, the first activist activists of the anatomy and explain them why.
What they reduced was an anatomical concept and they replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and moved for 200 years.
And as everybody remembers -- what they rejected our Fathers Foundation was the idea of the monarchy -- the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of the anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they were clear with the idea of birth right.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that they came up with political power for the water right to the father and then the son, etc.
The Fathers rejected that idea and replaced it by a new anatomical concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They sent the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not the anatomic differences -- that was a very radical thing.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of an embedded system where two things were being wasted.
It was managing democracy and at the same time, the science was born.
And it's very clear, if we look at the history of the Foundation, that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a natural world.
They were spreading from supernatural explanations and therefore they rejected the concept of supernatural power to be transmitted by a vague idea of birth right.
They were moving towards a natural concept.
And if we look, for example, the Declaration of Indonesia, talk about nature and the god of nature.
Don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And the idea of the way they were telling us the idea of anatomical coincidence.
And by doing so, they were feeling the foundations of the future movement of Civil rights.
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women succeeded.
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the Hall Treed heat, who said, "I'm not a woman?
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, color people who applied to anatomical coincidence over the anatomical difference, and again, they succeeded.
We see the same with the disability movement.
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the conservations, we have to start asking ourselves, why are we keeping certain diversity.
But attention, I want to keep some anatomical division in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't mean we should be able to get up to the anatomy for anatomy.
I don't mean that five years old were allowed to be allowed to have sexual relationships or married.
There are some anatomic division that for me makes sense and I think we should keep it.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings attached at the beginning of this talk.
We have two series, both of them considered by 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine one of them, Mary was born three months before time -- June 1, 1980.
Henry, the contamination was born in term, was born on March 1, 1980.
For just having been born three months before Mary was attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent, the right to bear, the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other barriers in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered man -- if I didn't tell you if it's X-ray, in virtue of being considered man now is possible from mandatory incarceration, which Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary on the side of the part, he doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in every state, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So they still persist anatomic categories that in various aspects are problematic and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science advanced so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point to have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could demonstrate?
I don't want to quit science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is chosen to us.
Where are we going?
It seems like what happens in our culture is a kind of a pragmatic attitude -- "Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do it."
But a lot of people are trapped in a rare position.
For example: Texas at a time has decided that to marry a man doesn't have to have chromosomes and to get married with a woman you have to have chromosomes and and a woman.
Now, in practice they don't do criminal tests to people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of the insurance syndrome of the animation.
If you look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech.
It says that we should judge people not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their cartoon: going beyond the anatomy.
And I mean, "Yeah, the idea seems very good."
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on the content of their career?
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be based on this to guarantee rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some of the things that probably deserve social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some laboratories that I know can make more informed decisions and smart and maps about their sexual relationships that people of 40 I know.
So how do we put in practice the subject of cartoonist?
Very hard.
And one part of me is wondering what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with a magnetic resonance in the future.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States continues to keep this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we'll do good work in the future.
We don't live for example, for example, in a context like Iranian in which a man who feels attracted by other men is susceptible to be killed, unless he is willing to overcome a change of sex, in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one that I talked about a couple of years ago that he had done a couple years ago that he had made light twins and then pick them up and get her fame to it.
But when the phone asked him the reason of operation was a very risky operation, I was told that in that other country these kids would be very mallupsionally and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, has the political asylum instead of surgical separation rather than surgical separation.
The United States offers huge possibilities to people who are without forcing them to change for the right of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to finish I mean I've been talking a lot about the parents.
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to the mothers.
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist -- and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different anatomical types, in particular, if there are people thinking about groups.
For years, since I've been interested in international, I've also been interested in investigating sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about the cultural studies is that women, on average, not all, but on average, they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to occupy those who are vulnerable within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in the painting, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in the feminism -- I was considered feminist -- as I did -- I made a strange plant."
"Tell me what the phenomenon has about female."
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
The feminist is about getting gender stereotypes, so there's nothing female in the female."
But the more I thought about the question, the more it has seemed to me that there is something female in the feminist.
That is, there might be something -- on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more attention to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if parents were really encouraged to find a way to protect people on the part of the state, it is possible that, of having injected more mothers, to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with a reciprocal support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we take democracy beyond the anatomy, think less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect, think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where it wants to go live and work, it has the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with one city willing to get them.
But the amazing thing about cities is that they value much more than their building cost.
So we could easily deliver the world tens -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just replace them by apartment buildings.
Imagine that half the people who wanted to live in apartment are already owned and that at the other half still would still be missing.
They could try to increase the ability to increase animations in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you face is that those buildings and areas around them have rules to avoid the molecules and the distribution distractions of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those amazing.
But they could go to a totally new place, building a whole new apartment building, always and when the rules of that place facilitate the construction instead of putting them together.
So I proposed that governments create new enough areas of reform enough to contain cities and give them a name, cities under height.
Later I learned that more or less at the same time, January and October were thinking about the challenge of reform Hond.
They knew that every year about 75,000 hospitals would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and make those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, the world has been a destroyed constitutional crisis.
In the next regular election, Pete Lob is incredibly implemented with a platform in which it promises reforms and the same reconciliation.
He asked October, he was his boss of game.
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDx.
Through a process of perfection and trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under status to their most essential ideas.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say you can't go and take all the current apartments of apartments of apartment.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies as normal to progress, and usually it's the rules that prevent us forward.
In the ozone of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent eighth a link with the TEDTalks.
I showed it to Jack.
They called me.
They said, "Let's take this to the leaders of our country."
So in December we met in Miami, in a hotel conference room.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities, much more valuable than their monetary cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York -- and let's look at that, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, October said, "Parachu, maybe we could see the video of TED talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a state city is a place where you start with set terrorists, a statue that specifies the rules that will apply there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of Hondterships called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our country to move forward.
I was asked to go to Tuckmitter and talk again about four to five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, who was trying to explain that to generate a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of Dendi and the white line is the new airport that was built in Denian.
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the honors that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that measures at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everyone applaud corresponds.
The public faces were very serious and attention.
The Congolese leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor Rumber, thank you very much for your talk, but maybe you could see the video of the TEDTalk talk.
I have it here in my computer."
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalks.
And this explained how essential a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you might be able to be in Honduras. Instead of hundreds of miles away north.
And it also involves new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the London government would need help for aid countries, they could benefit from the associated countries that helped them establish and make the norms of the status so that everybody could trust that the statue is effectively completed.
We went and saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It might be easily about 1,000 square miles.
And soon after that, the 19th of January, voted in Congress to expand their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow these special regions to development.
In a country that just went through this painful crisis, the vote in Congress for this constitutional pandemic was 124 to one.
All the parties, all the factors in the society, the response.
To include the Constitution, you have to take twice in Congress.
The 17 of February was approved again in another voting of 114 to one.
Immediately after the voters of the 21, 21 to February 24, a deligion of about 30 honors was the two places in the world who are more interested in participating in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that's being built in South Korea, it's bigger than the Boston center.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the permission for it.
The other country interested in the building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this as a practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators to come, and at once they would allow to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the last instant transition for this new judicial system.
There are urban corruptions and cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've been solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that want to install in the Americas, especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there are many people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to immediately change another place.
There's a million dollars a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go to their family to go get a job -- sometimes they're solar mothers that have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, there are even kids trying to meet with their parents that they haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in Hondragors?
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to think about insisting so that families can choose between several cities that are competing to attract new resistance?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my honor friends asked me to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm Jesus, and this is my value.
But before you show you what is inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and that is, I live obsessed with traces.
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photograph and publish in my blog board anti-feeding and colorful and different for each of them.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of public markets and seconds of second hand.
Oh, thank you.
Second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my guard in the environment and in my pocket.
I get to know interesting people, usually my money goes to a good cause, and I think it's unique, and buy becomes my personal pursuit of testing.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my table?
I'd like color color?
It's less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
To go back to my value, I want to tell you what I pushed for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone who has all that clothes?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought in.
I've brought seven inner clothing pairs and nothing else.
And the interior rock for exactly a week is all I put in my value.
I guess I would be able to find everything else that I wanted to use after here to Palm Spinals.
And because they don't know me as the woman who was walking through TED in inner clothes,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
Doesn't it sound interesting.
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is a bright tiger I call it.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the thing, including the chair, cost me 55 -- and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
Monday, the color is energy.
It's almost inevitably impossible to be bad humor, when you're wearing a brilliant red plant.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
Mars: The integration is supporting.
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you surrounded you from the right people, you're not just going to understand you, you will also appreciate you.
Mirrocraps: Guide of the child's children.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like I play the discontents -- or I remind them to their seven years old.
I like to smile and say, "Thank you."
Jesses," trust is the key.
If you think you see good with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't see it well with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside and you have no look at that you can't catch up.
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
Voice: A universal truth six words for you: The displaced lengths go with everything.
And finally, I was supposed to develop a personal style of itself, and one is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all of this is not going to go into my little value.
So before I go home, Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to embrace these things, because at the back of the corner, there will always be another crazy suit -- colorful and bright specifically, if there's a little love in my heart and search for it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if we used a scale to measure every single health, we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical one.
This would be somebody who's totally intuitive.
So where would you take your brain on this scale?
Some of them would operate for one of these extremes -- but I think for most of the interest of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great altitude in both of the hemisphere at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually excuse.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider one of those people, that just like most other experimental physical physicists, we need pretty logical to support these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty much intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this intuition? Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them, and then we see how they react -- and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
A certain intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing can be only in a place at a time.
I mean, it can sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion -- they developed it.
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
He was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, it always fell down.
But I bet the playing with that parking barrier taught a precious lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow them to take them, and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physics.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking walls, play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they find that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations and they called quantum mechanics theory.
And at that point was the physics a few years ago, you needed the quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That was not really based on my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody ever saw a particles.
But it didn't do well to my logical part.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then shouldn't it all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find reason why it should not.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
So a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a quantum mechanical superconductor.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the metal period I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to extend it a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we do a very big approach to the small metal trick.
So what we see is a little bit of metal perspective, and it is a transportation of transportation and that you put out on a platform.
And so I did this almost in the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this little bit of swimming palm that is found under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum superintelligence, but for it it needs a bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people get up to do those things, because I don't want them to bother them, or actually get scared.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The travel companies of inanimate objects are not just people, it's the light that you light it and the wind that goes on to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this metal period to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to push all the other passengers to expose.
And that's what we did.
We put the lights off, then we introduced a vacuum and we extracted all the air, and then we face it to a temperature of less than a degree per absolute zero.
Now, when you're alone in the electron, the little piece of metal is free to act as you want.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of perfectly cheese, I was vibrating -- and the way it was vibrating was like a response in this way -- as a flu that expands and controlled.
And by giving you a soft supply, we were able to make it visit and don't visit at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a flying thing and doesn't come at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the tons of atoms that confirm that piece of metal are tears and at the same time that same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in instant certain when those are floating.
In the rest of the time they're disappeared.
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which is at once means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It's worth getting into a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the large-scale difference between one atom and that metal piece is more or less the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places -- why not you?
I mean, it's my logical part that talks about.
So imagine if they were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was developed in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we heat it, and we switched on the lights and looked inside the box, we saw that the metal is still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuitions -- seemingly all objects in the elevator actually only are quantum objects that are just made in a small space.
You hear a lot about the quantum mechanics that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound branch of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is Amy.
And 18 months ago, I did another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss who is here and allowed me to take it to me.
It took me 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories, I assure you, with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on demand.
There is a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is simply explained in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I Google from a great education -- I didn't complain -- but I didn't have access to many of these museums and art work.
So when I started traveling and going to museums. I started learning a lot.
And working at Google, try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
But I better show you the demo and then explain a couple of interesting things that we have conducted from their launch.
So we just go to Googlerning ...
Look around all the museums that there are.
There's the Falment gallery -- the Mommy, the Emicros, the Richard, the Goggland Van.
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, to the Methoda, the New York art museum of art.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and paint, we are already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, Bombay, or Mexico, that doesn't really matter.
You're moving around and fun.
Do you want to navigate for the museum.
We opened up the plane, and with one click we just jump in.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall.
They go forward. They go down."
They explore.
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
I am now in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The Copenhagen of Peter British at Motorch.
I see the mark.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here is all the metaphors here.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click up there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the giant technology.
So this image, for example, contains it, I think, about 10 million people.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10 million people?
So I'm going to show you what it really gets with 10 million people.
It can make it very simple.
You see different things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to deep.
So I started playing play, and I found something that happened there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems interesting.
I went into and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I went through a little bit, I talked to some of the Methods of the Metropolitan -- and actually I discovered that this is a game called "uncontrolled: which is to hit an ocean with a stick.
And it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get further in depth and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to zoom through the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So now we're quickly going to jump again to MoMA in New York.
Here's another favorite of my favorites, "The night stable."
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the psychologists?
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this teacher teacher."
It increases it and it really makes it happen.
I go to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is the night started -- I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things here, but I don't have time to show you.
This is the really cool part. It's called Collections."
All of you, absolutely everyone, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a manipulation, that gives the same.
You can online create their own museum, create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we come in, and I created this function that I call "The power of the Romone: -- we just made a zooming around.
It's about "The Grandfathers at the National Gallery of London.
You can put things up, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you have these masterpieces controlled.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even either.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium makes a justice to the art of art, and it is properly represented online.
And the big question that I'm doing today is you did this to repeat the experience of going to a museum and going to a museum.
And the answer is no.
It's to get the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a press, a flying press.
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from an Italian origin, all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of their bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it's happened very interesting in Fortune 1 in the last two decades.
It's some time ago, if you wanted to win a Fortune One, I took a budget and you put it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the career.
This is what in engineering is called real time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two components and a sensor and an active.
The interesting thing is that the real time systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming computer in the air.
And as such, they're starting to respond differently, and they can be detected and accessible.
Congratulation is a big thing.
As a result, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the world's cortex -- but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
It's 75 percent of the energy consumption and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be something big.
Beyond cities, all these detections and activists are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of Paul Antarctica for late year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called "Talk To me."
Well, our objects, the environment, start to talk.
In a way, it's like almost every existing atoms become sensors and active.
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like in the old dream of Michelangelo.
You know, when Michelangelo angel screw the Mosque, he says that at the end I took the hammer, and he took it to the Moses -- in fact, still you can see a little beach underneath it, and he said, "Progress not stopped painting: "What don't you talk about?"
Well, today, our environment starts to talk.
And I'm going to show you just a few examples.
Let's start with it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of holiday in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup of the world.
Maybe some of them remember it, played Italy and France, and at the end of Ziddown Zido gave the head.
And anyway, the end won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day looking at the activity that is happening in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the Colon in the middle and the Earth River.
It's morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
For the early afternoon, there are people around here and there making called, moving.
And it starts the particular party."
Frankle Google Gold.
Interviewer, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of the regular time.
First additional time, second.
Ziddle, and in a moment, the head of the head.
Gando Italy, yeah.
That night everybody went to celebrate the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day they all went into the middle of the winning team and the prime minister of then.
And then everybody went down.
You see the image of the place called Circle Massachudes, which is from the room time, people are going to celebrate. It's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of detection, it's not about people, but things we use and consume together.
Today we know all about the process of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a Mac -- how they assemble it.
But we know very little about where things are going.
So in this project we developed a little bit of small tags to track the trash in its disappearance by the system.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were throwing out, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all forms throw in.
And then we put a little chip, one tag on the trash and then we started tracking it.
These are the results.
From Seattle.
after a week.
With this information, we realized that there are lots of implications in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
There are complicated things happening and there's a lot of unnecessary transportation.
But the other thing we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that we do is not disappeared, that is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we run one day still is still there.
That if we show that to people, then we can promote some behavior change.
That was the reason why.
My colleague at MIT, Samana Bioria, could tell us much more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we mentioned at the beginning, which is to act on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zargard.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology can, new technology, will join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine that they have a chaos and values, soldiers of solar lengths, lens that are open and shut down.
It's created as a water cortex, with water prisoners.
If you fall the pixels you can write on them, you can show patterns, images, text.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the Blue mayor here.
I liked a lot.
And they set up a commission to design the building of the Exposure.
We call it Digenda Water Polar.
The whole building is made of water.
There are no windows or windows or windows -- but when you approach it to you so you can happen.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize the savings, you get down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days there will always be somebody in the winter when they go down the roof, somebody who was there and he said, "Let's have the building development."
No, not that they have demonstrated, but when it comes down almost all the architecture disappears.
This is in operation.
You see people intrigued by what's going on.
And here I am trying to not move when I test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night it was really even more fun.
Every child in Zagazi came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open up to go by, but a building that kept making cuts and holes of water and you had to jump out to not move.
(Audience noises) And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use of people to give our designs.
But then reality is always uncomfortable.
And that's the beauty to do things to interact that people use.
This is an image of the building with physical pixels -- water pixels and water prosthetics and projection about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air, and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one that we saw before, which moves with others in synthetic.
We could form this cloud.
Sort of a flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, where what it changes is light, not the position of the pressures.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes.
And then all of that could be a 3D pixels cloud that you can zoom in, and go through and see from very different angles.
This is the real controlled Florida, going down to form a saw, like before.
When you turn the light, you see this. The same thing you saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have every pixel with an entrance that comes from people, from the movement, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with Robert Bolly -- one of the best ballet dancers of today, the star of the New York City of the New York City and the Milwaukee Simplicity, to capture their 3D movements and use it as input for Florida.
Here we can see Robert dancing.
On the left you see the pressures, the capture in different resolution.
It's so much 3D diagrams in real time as a movement capture.
It can rebuild the whole movement.
You can turn all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and motivation.
We want to use this as a possible entry for Florida.
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the cloud.
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment -- almost like a cloud of clouds, like a grain cross, but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody give a little bit for a press.
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we move from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed you, we can move from the digital world, the professional power of networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a symbol.
That means something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today, think about climate change or CO2 emissions. How do we move from digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved to do this together, collectively.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud they're pressure.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered pressures.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve to share the main moments of the 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can climb up, like a new summit of London.
You can go in there.
As if it was a new digital failure at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what they are?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve memory by a more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better form, be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and safe than yourself.
What about more with good health?
Or maybe they are those people who wanted to be more creative.
What else would you like?
What would you like if you could choose something?
Audience: Creative." creativity.
How many people would choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
A few. It's probably a number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you would choose your memory?
Some more.
What about the physical state.
A little less.
How about longevity?
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something of this the world would be very different.
Is it just imagination?
Or maybe be possible?
Evolution has been a sense here at TED conference, but today I want to give you the view of a doctor about it.
The great generation of the 20th century, TED Koshuaguda, who was in the church of the Russia, wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes a sense of the light of the Evolution."
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this: Is it just about past, or the future?
Does it mean the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch -- well at an end, is, of course, the most interesting thing.
We derived from a common ancestor with modern chimps about six or eight million years ago.
In the intervening has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of humans.
Some have gone back.
We've been here about 130 years old.
It might seem to be very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
Do you realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human insulin that is used to treat diabetes?
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, chemically inevitable, of which comes out of prison.
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the most bacterial intestine than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, do you think -- when Antonio Damases raises me about the automatic -- think about bacteria?
The gut is a wonderful hospital environment for those bacteria.
It's warm, dark, temperature, is very complex.
And we're going to provide them all the nutrients that they can want without effort of their parts.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional interpretation of some force in the wild.
But by the way, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest essential nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future stop us?
Are we in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the environment?
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief companies, the animal kingdom, as one and unique companies, and human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the entertaining part of this talk, so I hope you've enjoyed it.
When I went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by choice and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in the single-celled organisms, every cell simply is divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to two daughters daughter.
But when the multinational organisms appear. Things start to change.
The sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes predictable.
In fact, you might say that the inevitable death of death comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I thought, well, sexually, sexting, death per sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year I went by, every single year I had more doubt.
I got to understand George Burns feelings that still act in Las Vegas in his 90 years.
And one night somebody hits their hotel door.
He opens the door.
In front of it is a magnificent blank dance of clothes.
He looks at it and he says, "Come on for a sex solution."
"It says George, I choose the sound."
I realized, as a doctor, that I was working for a different goal to the objective of evolution, not necessarily contractive, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
He wanted us to keep us healthy.
I wanted to recover health in disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is in passing the genome to the next generation, adapting and survival after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are as refugee rockets to send the genetic load to the next orbital level, and then let me fall into the sea.
I think we all understood the feeling that Woody Allen was when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to make it not die."
Evolution doesn't necessarily necessarily favor longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and even the smartest and even the smartest thing.
Evolution favors the better addictions to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
At the bottom of the ocean the key bacteria that can survive the heat of the forms that would produce, if there were fish there, fish cooked into the vacuum, yet they've managed to do that a player environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution, and if we think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward to the following phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first is that we don't evolve.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been thrown and eliminated from population.
And secondly, as a species, we've confirmed our environment to adapt to us as we are adapt to him.
And by the way, we migrated and circles, and we are so excited that it's no longer possible to have the necessary isolation for evolution.
A second possibility is that a traditional kind of evolution is produced by traditional type, natural tax by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution will be developed, but they're unbelievable.
And in terms of the isolation: when as as a species we put distant planets are going to exist the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce natural way.
But there's a third possibility -- attractive and intriguing and terrifying possibility.
The so-called neuroscientist, new evolution, which is not just natural, but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the decisions that we will make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more locations than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what is chosen to individual and family.
Think also that if you could be able to be able to choose not only the sex of your descent, but in your own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
What if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce cancer risk or remove approach?
Would those changes want to make those changes in their genes.
If we look at the future, that kind of changes will become increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and it was 13 years.
It cost two billion dollars.
The next year I had done, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the human genome base at a cost near 20,000 and a week.
It will not have a lot to do so that the human genome does for 1,000 and getting more and more in the scope of all.
You get those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves from themselves but they're going to induce immune against other viruses.
Believe it or there is no experimental trial in course with the cultural influence of the culture of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good than coming out of the table?
That's reality today and in the future is going to become increasingly possible.
Imagine then only two little tricks.
Can they change the cells of their bodies, but if they could change the cells of their descent?
What if they could change sperm and villages, or change the record recent value, and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, remove the diabetes, remove the homosexuality, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more healthy kids.
And then, that same analytical technology, that same driver of science that changes to prevent diseases will also allow us to adopt supporting hypertexts -- a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken Jennifers on everything if you could increase it with the next generation of the Watson machine generation?
Why not have a faster control muscle that allows us to run faster and more distance?
Why not live longer?
This is going to be irrelevant.
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before the neocortex.
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100,000 years, and we can compress it to 1,000 years and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
Are we going to use these choices in a better society, more successful, more considerably?
Or are we going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others?
Are we going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform or more random and more vertical?
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound of all, are we going to be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom necessary to make these decisions safe?
For good or worse, and before what I might think, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor by clicking click, click, click, click.
Classic, click, click, click, class.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the 1.
It was the only one who could talk to flight assistant.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. We probably hit some birds.
The pilot had already flown the plane, and we were not so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot feeds the airplane with the Hudson River.
It's usually not the route.
The motors appeared.
Imagine being in an airplane and no noise.
And then he said three words.
I think the three most desperate words I've heard.
He said, "Let's prepare for the impact."
I didn't have to talk more about flight assistant.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life was done.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in an instant.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I didn't do that, all the fences I wanted to do, all the experiences I have wanted to have and never had.
While I was thinking about that further, I came up with a sentence, which is, "Collection came bad."
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it.
I don't want to apply anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has actually changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is while we were avoiding George Washington, which was not for a lot of -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a great fight.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity I also give rise to my ego.
And I regret the time I wasted on things that didn't matter with people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a measure in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like wonderful.
I don't try to be right. Eleanor will be happy.
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock goes down, 15,000 14, 13.
You see the water.
I'm saying, "Please fly me."
I don't want this to break into 20 pieces as you see in those documents.
And as we went down, I had the feeling of, Wow, die not fear.
It's almost like we've been preparing for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go. I love my life.
And that sadness came into a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade -- not a lot of artistic talent -- still --  And scream.  And scream.
And to me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
And at that point I understood that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I got a miracle of a miracle, not to die that day.
And I got another gift to me, which was the possibility of looking at the future and back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and please don't be that -- but imagine how they change?
What do they do, they still hope to do because they think they're going to live forever.
How do they change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, are the best parents that they can."
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with a lot of amazing projects.
But the biggest thing I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called TEDTalk.
TED was one of the most important graffiti gravitates in the 1980s.
One day he got to his house after she ran and said, "Dad, I feel a mirror in the legs."
And that was the beginning of ALS.
The TED has a total paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and respect in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony TED, and his cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with it?
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, isn't that what Stephen Hawking -- not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those appeals?
And he said, "No, unless you be an important thing and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?
Anyone to see the movie "The School and the marketing?
They communicate in that way. They go through the finger.
I said, "That's architect. How can it be?
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of signed a crash that had no idea how to cover it.
I committed to her brother and his father there at that particular moment, "All right, so this is the treatment: Tony is going to be treated, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to go back to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who is so much in their interior can't communicate it."
So I talked about a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called GRI Reading Lab: who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser point, draw on that and record the negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that come up, they say, they're part of a cycle of life.
They first start with sexual organs, then with bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and at the end, people start making art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their presentations.
And so he started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of the way to move the things back to the other side of the side of the side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the doors of insurance companies and we got a machine so that the TED could communicate, a machine like Stephen Hawking.
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most fun thing -- I call it You boy, because when I talk to the type, you get an email of it, and you say, "I don't deserve it. This guy is fantastic."
The other thing we did was we brought seven programmers around the world literally from all the corners on the planet to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved the garage back and these hackers and programmers and conservations and analysis took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we did something completely stupid and when we went back there would have taken out the squares of the walls and they would have graffiti it.
But for two weeks we program, we went to Venezuela Martin, my son was part, my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called "Editralia "Stranger, "The TED and you can see the description of it.
These are a couple of cheap maps that we bought in the brown step of Venezue Beach, some copper wire and Homo Department and Radio Shake.
We took a PSA camera, we open it, we put it on a light of LED and now there's a device that is free, and we publish the free code, and the software is low for free.
And we create a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There's no hospital I can say "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much to you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to TED room.
I love this picture because this is another person's room, and that's their room.
There was all this biologist and anger for the great incompanie.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming -- intense sessions.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life, and it's looking through the support system of your life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a project on a wall of the parking hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and he would imagine what the feeling was in parking it.
The funny thing was that we had to invest in parking so we felt like we were reading graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he told us, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and somebody would finally come back and get me out there so I could breathe."
Isn't it wonderful?
In a way, that's our war scream.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device but it's the equivalent of a magic screen.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's free, none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is fantastic."
Armstrong hits something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up closing the circle, is that in April of this year at the Geoffree of the MoMA in downtown Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called "Art in the Colders."
And Art in the Colders is going to have the best exports in urban art Babbage, Shekha Facebook, Christians. They're all going to be there.
TED is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, make it possible.
Nothing that is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the Wright, nothing was possible at some point.
So make it possible to make it possible.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with eye recognition. I just recognized something and I was associated with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us every day when we find something that we feel like we need to do -- if it's not now, what? And if I'm not me, who is it?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years getting into a very difficult situation and at the same time a lot dangerous.
I went to prison, difficult.
He worked in a coal mineral, dangerous.
Film in areas of war and difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating this -- fun at first, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been immersed in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal of trying to try to examine social questions in ways that are attracting attractive, interesting, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that was trained and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to make a TEDTalk about the world of brands and the pathogenic wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard it, or no, a couple weeks ago I took a bird in Ebora.
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What was following the following: "The United States NOLs presented -- my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about in your face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company when you do so.
But I said this is a very good medical opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these TEDTalks?
A lot.
It's a program in progress, by the way.
So even with that wild I knew that somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked you a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to get them with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we look at the world of marketing.
And as I said earlier, I've got into horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could prepare me -- nothing could be anticipated, for something as hard to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan Space: I want to make a film that deals with product planning, marketing and advertising, and that all the film is funded with production of products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call the film largest ever selling."
What happens in "The largest movie ever sold is that all of the top down at the bottom of the start, has marks of brand, all the time -- from the application that comes before the title, the X brand.
Now this brand, Common Stanford, the Central States.
These people are going to be associated with film, forever.
And so the film explores all this idea. (Miller Kashmen: It's reduced."
I'm a red piece. MK: I just say that. It was more for the teeth.
It was "All "The Perspective."
But we're not just going to have the X-ray pattern in the title but we're going to make sure we're going to ensure all the categories that we can on the film.
Maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the most great shoe you've used use.
The most cool car you've been driving in "The largest movie ever sell: the best suit you have drink, cortex of "The largest movie ever selling."
French Kocah: The idea is in addition to show the marks as part of life, making them fund the film: (Music: Making funding the film: MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the complete film is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the film of beginning to end.
And I would love that CEOs help make it happen.
Robert Frank: You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that. It's the ultimate respect for audience.
GB: However, I don't know how much it is going to be people to be.
WK: You have a perspective.  I don't know if you get a very negative angle -- but you know how it's going to represent -- MIT: No idea. David Cohen: How much money do you need to do this?
MS: One and a half million -- DC: All right. John Kamen: I think it's going to be hard to meet the meeting with them, but it certainly is going to be able to convince a couple of big brands.
NK: Who knows, maybe for the moment that film is going to be seen as a lot of joyful ideas.
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart Rudes: Most of the answers will be no.
MS: But being hard to sell it, for the film or to be me?
JK: Both things.
MS: ... -- it means you're not very optimistic.
So, help me? I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. MK: Okay. Impossible.
MK: We need to think about what marks are.
MS: Yeah. MK: That's the challenge. When you look at the people you have to deal with.
MK: We have a few places where to go. (Music: OK. Turn out the camera.
MS: I thought that "I was called the camera, and we have a conversation outside microscope.
The camera means, "We don't want to know anything about your film.
MS: And so, one of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of you wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
You didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very impressed -- I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, making so many people would see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario, is not the idea with that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to take the message to the mass?
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a wonderful mistake, and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you're looking for transparency images at Google --   -- this is one of the first images that come up.
I like your rolling way, Sergey Brian. No.
This was the problem: the transparency, free of simulation or deception -- easily detected or seen -- easily understandable, which is characterized by visible visibility.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians are name, the president of the name, even the CEOs named it.
But all of a sudden when it's about making it reality, something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives fear --  -- like that weird bear that still keeps playing.
It's impressive.   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it risk?
Let me eat a whole bowl of Color White.
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and saying that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to tell a story.
We want you to tell a story, but you tell our story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father caught me in some lie -- and there he is looking at him as he used to do it, and he said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's the real story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just one company, an agency wanting to help me, and that only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirbida from many years, I realized I would have to go on my own, I would have to take out of the interpretation and go to the companies myself with my whole team.
So what I started to realize all of a sudden -- what I started to realize, is that when you start to convince the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big movies, enormous, giant and others who make small movies, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make big Hollywood movies -- giant giant, they say the reason their films are so successful is due to the associated brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movie films?
And the movie is called "The largest movie ever selling."
How are we going to see Bay specifically in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my bottle, you'll see the Descrument Bang.
At any time during an interview with somebody I can say, "Are you very cool for this interview and so on.
Are you ready? You're a little nervous.
I want to help you shut up.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the interview."
And there is one of these fabulous weapons.
Both "For "The Personal People as "Dissensure "Everests are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a woman, solid to ball, in bar.
That's the general view.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a promote look.
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
So similar to the smaller kind of movies that you would have, we're rather a rival brand.
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands have.
So doing things like this, you know, remember Batman to people is the reason that we're interested in.
MS: What words use to describe Bane?
Bang is in white.
KB: That's a big question.
Volunteer: Super-controlled.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put in the army.
Man: We talk about something boring, fragile.
I think "I feature is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus the smell and the surf.
You keep you fresh.
How do you keep you cool more time? With better fraction, more frequency, three times more fresh times.
Things like the ones that the benefits are.
MS: And that's a multinational company.
What about me? What about a common guy?
I need to talk to the man on the street, people like me, to the commons.
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your brand?
Man: Mim my brand?
I don't know.
I like a good clothing.
Woman: I was going to revive the 80 percent -- public pattern unless it's lasting land.
MS: Okay, what's the German brand is?
Germ, something unique. (Music: "Not many -- I guess the type of gender, the style that I have would be like a dark malaria."
I like dark colors, many gray and things like that.
Usually I carry access like sun, or I like the crystals and similar.
Woman: If Dan was a brand that could be a classic constant, Merchan Benjamin.
Man 2: The brand that I am, the brand call called calculator."
Woman 2: In part of hypothesis, partly blog, "Brand Brooklyn: I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of machines.
I sell toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that is my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is Federal because I put the market in.
Man 5: failed.
Is that something that?
Abraham: I'm a lawyer frame.
Tom: I'm Tom.
MS: Well, not all of us can be March March, but I often classify in the dark glass intersection and calm flight."
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call "marketing personality."
And I found a company called Obama Zalbie in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like Nethan, February, Harvard to discover that marker personality.
If they could do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
Army: Trace the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people model my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that you live in, as the people who surround you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you make.
All of those things originated and start in a place and in my case they originate and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about?
MS: The next thing is, "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things. I like weird things.
A: Tell me about "Why," what does that serve us?
What is the male? What is the powder phase you find now?
Why is it important to research? What does the red do?
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more than you, which is not who you are.
What other metaphors have you have?
You don't have to have fear. What kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: Hey!
A: Thank you for your patient. MM: Great job. A: Yes. MS: Thank you very much. All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness.
Lindan Zagan: The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides, but complexity, in your brand, the Morgan Space brand, is a constant brand.
They're very well-being together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only focus on one of their strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's human nature, to avoid the things that they're not sure -- they avoid fear, those elements, and you actually get a little positive to you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are these?
The first here is classic -- Apple one.
And you can see here to Tory, Wikipedia, mine from mine Coopers and Jets.
Now there are playful marks and conscious brands, those things that you've gone and come and a legitimate brand is pretty powerful.
MS: A cognitive brand -- what's your brand?
If someone asked you to describe your identity of brand, your brand, what would it be?
Are you an advice attribute? Are you somebody who makes blood submit?
Or are you rather a disabled attractive?
A little bit more calm, reserved, conservative?
So the advice attributes are like being playful like being a predatory like the Price, contemporary -- announcement, airplane or bold like Eric Florida, fast or church, drug, dominant or mystical like Gandhi.
Or are you rather than disabled attractive?
Are you conscious, sophisticated like 70?
Are you stable, traditional property, protection protection, protected with Oprah?
Are you reliable, stable, familiar, confident, safe, saturated, consistent, consistent or wise like the Dalai Lama or Young York?
In the course of this film, we had more than 500 companies, responsible and descendants who said, "No, they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mainly because they had no control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
We were allowed to tell the story of neuroscientist, and we got to tell the story in this film of how they now use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of the desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing as for movies.
We went to San Paulo where they've banned the advertising of the public air.
In the entire city over the last five years, there are no values, no characters, no wind.
And we went to school district where companies are doing way in schools with limitation problems in America.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects I have had the biggest answer or in which I've been more successful are those in which I've been interacting with things directly.
And that's what these marks did.
They took the interpretations, they took their agencies, and they said, maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with artist directly.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you have it? Did you have success?
Well, since the movie is trained in the Sensal September, let's take a look.
According to Burroughs the movie, and since then -- and this is not all -- we've had 900 million printers in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two and a half weeks.
That's just online, no press, no TV.
The movie is still not distributed yet.
It's not online. It's not in stranger.
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all of the agencies that we talked about to their customers will not be part of it.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you take people out of that you're pushing them into failure.
I think when you train their employees in the risk to risk is preparing all your company to get out of reward.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to risk.
We need to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities that can scare them.
Ultimately, to move forward, I think we have to give a place to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
We open the fear. We open the risk.
From a shoulder at a time, we have to embrace risk.
And in fact, we have to increase transparency.
Today more than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go to a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk "We "Are "According to "The Transparency has been presented by my good EMC friends who for 70,000 business bought the rights of the name in Earth.
EM: It makes big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
EMC presented "Association the Transparency.
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So Morgan, in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those 70?
MS: It's an exceptional question.
In my pocket, I have a clash to the name of the Matther Medical organization, the Saying Foundation, a chicken for 7,700 to be applied to my TED for the next year.
The idea behind the statement computer Scott is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the uranium plant in Natasha in Natalie.
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we get to compromise these systems that control speed and valves we can cause a lot of problems with central.
The gray boxes don't use Windows software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put the Windows effective virus in a laptop computer used by an engineer to confirm this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind Steit Steven.
We started with a Windows install.
The bird income to the gray box is date, and the nuclear program will go in is too much.
It's easy, here?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching on Steit six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the Windows part of Windows -- the installed used multiple data vulnerability.
It seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes, these systems of control.
That called us attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with Steit and saw what was going on with this.
So they went very strange things.
Steit was complicated as a rat of lab that didn't like our cheese -- the wave but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after I experienced with different cheese sands, I realized, and I thought, this is a direct attack.
It's completely directly."
The installed is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it is effectively working in that place.
If not, Steve does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because I thought, "We don't know what the goal is.
It might be, let's say, for example, a U.S. energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than we discovered the goal soon.
So we went through and we took the code of attack, and we discovered that I was structured in two digital bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very deeply armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They knew all the points that I'll attack.
You probably even know how much the operator is.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the statement of Steit is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks like the old underlying language.
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for technicians and data structures, and we tried to relate them to the real world, with potential targets of the real world.
We need theories about devices that we can appreciate or desperate.
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent shame, it must be a blank white, and it's safe in Iran, because it's where most infections have been represented.
You don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils to the nuclear energy plant in Bush and the swimming plant in Natasha.
So I told my assistant, "Take a list of all the experts in centralized centers and energy plants between our clients.
I called them and told them in an effort to convince their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital office with the control of the robot.
The robot is that mobile part in the central, that black object you see.
If you manage the speed of this robot, you certainly can break it out and even make the central central interface.
What we also saw is that the attack goal was to make it slow and disappear in an obvious effort to go back to the nest maintenance engineers, so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital breeze by looking closely at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number 166 will be in that code, you can't get obvious.
I started researching literature on how these centers are built in Natasha and found that they're structured in what's called a capital, and each waterfall contains 166 centrical centers.
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These cybercriminals in Iran are divided in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the attack code.
A almost identical structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had among hands.
For no manufacturing, it wasn't like this.
The results have been obtained after several weeks of hard work.
We had routinely finished in calls and we had to come back and start.
Yet, we discovered that both digital oil would come to one and a single goal, but from different angles.
The small bird is taking a waterfall and making the robots and rating it, and the big oil communicates with six waterfall and manipulating valves and manipulating them.
In sum we are very confident that we've determined what the fate is.
It's Natal, and it's just Natalie.
We shouldn't worry about other targets that are achieved by Steven.
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- really impressed me.
There's the gray box, and up the central cards.
What this thing does is to intercept the input values of the sensors for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors and provide legitimate code, which is still executed during the attack, with false input data.
And believe it or not, this false entry data is programmed by Steven.
It's kind of like the Hollywood movies where, during the robot, the security camera is fed from video programmed.
Is it great there?
The idea here is obviously not just to block the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and agenda.
The idea is to build a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the big steam turbine is going on speed, you have to open up escape valve in a military.
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're committed, then they can spend bad things.
The plant can explore.
And no operations and the security system will notice it.
That scares that.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is genetic.
It has nothing to do, specifically, with centralizations, with uranium entertainment.
It could also work as well, for example, in an energy plant, or in an automotive factory.
It's genetic.
And you don't have a little attack -- which will disseminate this load with a USB key, as we saw in Steinowythes case.
You could also use conventional technology technology to disseminate it.
Tell him the most possible.
And if you did that, with what you end up with is a cycle of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We must face the consequences and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
Rale, it's been public in many sides that people assume that the Moscology is the main entity behind this.
What is your opinion?
Ralph Langaro: Okay, OK, you really want to hear this?
Yeah.
My opinion is that the Mose is involved, but the engine is not Israel."
The engine behind this is cyber superintendent.
There is one single one, and that's the United States, fortunately, fortunately, fortunately, fortunately, already.
Because otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you. Thank you, Rall.
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be carried and give suburban skills, or another one that makes users of wheelchair go back and walk.
In Berkeley Biospheres we call these robots, excessive.
They're nothing different from something you put in the morning, you give you a great force, and you also increase your speed, and you help him, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and machine.
But not only that -- you can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other foreign interests.
This is not an irrational idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we start talking about the American soldier that, on average, has to take on its back, a 45 pounds, and it's getting a lot more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage damage.
We decided to control this challenge and create an exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the Hunky -- or Port Carolina Human Cardinard Person.
Soldier: With the U.S. exoskeleton I can drop 90 pounds for variable terrain for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put on crops and execute movements with great activity.
I perceive what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then increase my strength and my resistance.
Extra Bengoing: We're ready, with our industrial society, to produce this device -- this new exoskeleton this year.
So it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of wheelchair users, about what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people right now, in wheelchair around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation here.
We talk about something that happens with often, very young people, with damage in the vertical column that when they start their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that makes it fast quickly.
Their only option, many times -- by a brain injury or some other complicated -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so over the last 500 years, from its successful appearance, as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the Electricity that Amanda Botter is using Amanda 11 years ago had a injury in the vertical column, and as a result couldn't walk back for 19 years, so far.
Adam Bottle: Thank you.
EB: Amazon is using our ELG, I mentioned.
You have some sensors.
It's completely not invasive in the crutches that send signals to the board computer, here in the back.
So here are some batteries that give energy to engines in the caps, and in the knees, and they make it move with this soft and very natural path.
AB: I was 24 at the top of my life when, by a strange leap in the air, skiing the bottom cost of the beet left.
In a second fraction of a second, I lost all sense and all motion of the penguins down.
Shortly later, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, "Amazon, you'll never walk.
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last piece of hope of my being.
The adaptation technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to deliver it down in scales, climbing rocks and even riding in hand.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just of soldiers, but to Amazon, and all the users of wheelchair to all all.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the battle, practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day, where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the photograph of Man Aristotle or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of Congo.
Boomers are, along with chimpanzees, their closest lives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their agriculture.
But unfortunately, we've done too much hyper-controlled in this aspect of our human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big type, terrifying society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very talented society where mortal violence hasn't been observed yet.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least understood of the big apes.
They live in the depths of the Congolese forest, and it's been very difficult to study them.
The Congo is a paradox. A land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the technology itself, stage of a violent conflict that has been protected for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction is also going to put the survival of the bone.
Carbon meat and deforestation make you can't fill a study with the bonobos that remain in the world, and honestly we're not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the hidden laughter by measuring trees.
Who are these prime?
We know them as the apes of love, not war, because they have frequent sex and promotion and bisexual to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the bonobos is more than the Samau Submark.
But bonus, like humans, love playing throughout all their lives.
Play is not just a child's game.
For us and for them, the game is fundamental to establish links and foster the tolerance.
We learn to trust, and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of diversity diversity diversity of interactions, diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity.
And when you look at the Bonobo game you see the evolutionary roots of laughter, dance and human ritual.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how to play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild survey.
First of all, it's a balance game game, and I don't talk about football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a perspective.
Look what she is.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "We have a shot of the balls."
I just think that in this case, he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common in bonus as humans.
And this video really is interesting because it shows -- this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like the testicles -- and also how the game requires trust and foster trust -- and at the same time it's the most fun.
But the game is philosophy.
The game is philosophy, it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more transplantation, imaginative -- maybe the place where the staggering is required.
And I want you to see -- this is Fublish, a young female who's playing with water totally.
I think, like her, we sometimes play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner and outer worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, and then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual seed of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is the key to these capabilities are.
In other words, the game is our comfort comment.
To adapt success to a world that changes we have to play.
But do we take our ability to play it?
The game is not fragmentatic.
The game is essential.
For Bonobo and humans alike, life is not just cruel and desperate.
When it looks like the least appropriate to play, it can be the moments that the most urgent thing.
So for that, primate companies, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as we manage creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York, I'm responsible to develop a nonprofit organization called Robin Howard.
When I'm not fighting the poverty, I fight fires as a captain assistant.
And in our city, where volunteers come to a highly qualified staff you have to get to the fire of the fire very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But still there was a road running against the other volunteers to get to the load and figure out what our task was.
When I found the captain -- I was trained in a conversation with the property that certainly was going to run one of the worst days of his life.
We were in the middle night, she was standing outside the rain, under a paradege, in piano, disappeared, while his house was in flames.
The other volunteer I just got before I was -- let's call him Leon Luther --  came first to the captain and he asked him to go and save the dog of the owner of the house.
The dog dog." I was so clear."
There was a money lawyer or a management that during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I came into a building in calls to save a live being just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me an administration.
He said, "Gene, I need you to go home.
I need to go up, grab the fire, and I bring this woman a couple of shoes.
I swear it.
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but I was -- I went up the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the real firemen that at that height or less had finished the fire and went into the fourth grade for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my charge back on the ladder where I met my November and the precious dog on the front door.
We got out of the house the tests for the owner of home where, as it was to expect, his testimony received a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter of the owner of home thank you for the brave effort shown to save your house.
The kindness that she observed about the other was that somebody had reached him even a couple of shoes.
So much in my location in Robin Hood, as my volunteer as a volunteer member I'm a generosity of generosity acts and kindness in a monumental scale, but also the acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look at this room to people who have achieved or are about to achieve -- remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: Don't wait.
They don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give to you now.
They serve food in a commercial, clean a park of the neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So they go into the game, save the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark Bears: Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a great fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were made in 1868 with a very simple idea: closed cord modules that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, as buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, LED came up with this.
It was called an automatic assembly brick cell.
And in a few years, LED bricks came to every home.
It estimated that they have been made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be engineering to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
LED made it accessible.
LED simply adopted the concrete block -- the favorite in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to advertise: the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic brick brick to each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block allows you to create a lot older and more complex circuits -- a brick at a time.
But there's a main difference, transition was just for experts.
I personally don't accept it, that the building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing engineers into the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing Little Little Little Little Litts.
I'm going to show you how they work.
Little Little Little Lostons are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're predicted to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they come together by images.
So you can't put it wrong.
Liberals have a code of color.
The green is the suit, the blue is the current, the pink is the input and the corrupt of orange is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green and very quickly you can start to make older circuits.
A blue with a green produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a regulatory.
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have an intermediate light.
We added this temperature to create more impact and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, Litens are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program and connect and soldiers, Little Liberals allows us to program using very simple intuitive gestures.
To make it faster or slower, it just turns this button that makes the pulse faster, or slower.
The idea behind Little Little Liberes is that it's a growing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to get back to brick bricks to use.
Lucies, sound, solar panels -- everything must be accessible.
We have given Litts to kids to see them play with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that doesn't learn in schools.
For example, how a light works, or why the door of a elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also brought Little Little Litts to design schools.
So, for example, designers without experience in electronics start playing with Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little literatures like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and failure, we have George create.
(Music method."  A few weeks ago we took Litts to the designer of Rhode Island design designers who have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, do something.
Here's an example of a project that they have done, a confidence condition active by movement.
But wait, here comes my favorite project.
It's a light station that is afraid of darkness.
For these no engineers, Litens became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in reach of everyone.
So Little Liberians has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and make them.
We want to encourage a world of creators and inventors and collaborators because this world that we live, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and invent it.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company sought to engage us with the environment focusing on the environment.
The collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
Hmm. Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in charge.
We can continue better -- we can keep the video on the side.
No.
This is not.
All right.
Solar technology is.
Oh, my time is terrible?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and techniques to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that they're supposed to stop -- we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called "Come America and would be like a Peace of Peace for telescopes.
We select some members every year and we put them to work with the musicians.
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send them to the savanna world.
They made great applications. They worked with the municipal employees.
Their task is to show the possibilities of the current technology.
You know Ala.
It's a horizon in Boston City.
Here appears as if I look for a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody cleans it when it stays in the snow because he knows it's not very good at opening up fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to help ask this very similar way?
Last year in Boston we had a team of Congo for America."
They were there in February, and at that time I was worth last year.
They realized that the city would never clean these hydrogens.
But one of the members named Erik Michaels noticed something else, that citizens cleaned with sticks right in front of them.
So he did as any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a hydrogen.
You accept cleaning it when it snow.
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, I put it Al.
If you don't do it, somebody can robe.
I mean, it has a players' component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 programmed applications last year.
But it does something that no other government technology.
And it spreads viral form.
A hospital responsible system in Honolulu, when we saw this app realized that I could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to adopt symbols of tsunami.
It's very important to work these symbol sympathying, but people steal the batteries.
So you ask the citizens to control them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens take off the satellite designers.
And Chicago just launched to make people record to clean sidewalks when it snow.
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has been spread without friction and organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology you'll know that it doesn't normally happen.
The software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
He was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that he had done the normal channels would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the court power of California, which has cost two billion dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that is programmed in a couple of days and spread viral shape is a kind of tyranny of warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the better ways to work, not like the private companies, like many people think it should be.
It's not like a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, no restrictions and open and generalization.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents how to tackle the question of the government that has the new generation, not as a problem of an analog institution but as a problem of collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building tools to work together with efficiency.
And it's not only "Come on America but there are hundreds of people around the country who contribute to civic applications every day in their own communities.
They have not been given to the government.
They feel a great frustration of that, but they don't complain -- they fix it.
And these people know something we've lost of view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row at the DVD R&D -- and all those other things that make us crazy -- the government is, essentially, to the words of Tim Right: "What we do together because we just can't can."
Now, many people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to recognize it, because things are changing.
Politics doesn't change, the government is.
And because the government in the last end of us -- remember that from "we" -- the way we think about it to affect how to produce change.
I didn't know a lot about government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government is to choose people to take care of them.
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about landscapes.
This is the phone care center of services and information.
It's the place that calls the calls if you mark 311 in the U.S.
Scott attacked this call.
Incredites Zarry in the office of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors out of the house, put good music and see if it's going?
And it worked. And so well for Scott for Scott for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the cardiologists.
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has an application, web and mobile called Cities Connectivity."
We don't program that app.
It was the very clever work of the New urban Mechanical Office of Boston.
One day, this happened really came this last study: "Gradually on my trash bucket -- I don't know if she's dead.
How do I do to take it down?
The dynamics of Cities Connection is different.
Scott was talking about people.
In Connecticut Connecticut" everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, I saw it a neighbors.
The next report said, "I went to the place, found the garbage cube behind the house.
Z? Yes. live? Yes.
I turned the cube back. I went home.
Good night, harmony harmony."
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of government income to distributed voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't necessarily mean the technology of platform technology.
I talk about a platform for people to authent and help others.
So, one citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And I could have connected to the government services of being necessary, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When one neighbor helps another, let's find the communities.
If we call control animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think that one is the entrance of the other.
That our entry system is the vote.
How many times have they chosen a political leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then expect the government to reflect our values and satisfy our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface of 15 inches down.
Below is what we call bubble.
And we say that word with a lot of depression.
But it's that depression that keeps us that that belongs to us that we fund as something that operates on our against that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we will have to make bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real government work occurs.
We have to collaborate with the government machinery.
That's the World movement.
Have you seen them?
It's a group of worried citizens that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the request of the Second Communication of Valley accountable.
That's not political activism -- it's bureaucratic activity.
And for those of us who have resisted to the government, it's time for us to ask what world we want to leave to our children.
You have to see the enormous challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really think that we will get where we have to go without solving the institution that can act in behalf of all?
We can't press government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to replicate the function of government so that it can expand by strengthening civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act manually, you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, to redesigned, I'm a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost by granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face who is going to talk about, they're all going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time, and they do.
So when you face the government problem you don't care much about making your voices.
They're using the hands.
They put the work to program applications that make the government better work.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning a hydrogen, taking malarias, dumping a garbage cube that has a cartoon inside.
Of course, we could always clean those hydrocarbons and many people do it.
But these applications are as a digital reminder that we're not only consumers -- we're not just consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We're more than that, we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix government until we don't fix the city.
So I want to ask all of the present, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, are we going to be a vote of voices, or will we be a handbag?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prison, prisons and the death corridor of death.
I've spent most of my life in marginalized communities, in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these stimuli has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are said here have impact around the world.
In occasions, if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that would not have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is really important.
Here we saw fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things -- it would be cartoonist, it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the practice of the right, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of an African-American family dominated by a marriage, which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, I had power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She wrote a lot of the dictionaries in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been scanner.
His parents were born in Schizopon over 1840.
She was born over 1880 and his experience with slavery as she looked at the world.
She was hard, but she was also a love.
When I was small and I looked at her, she came up with me and gave me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe, and then I was suspended.
One or two hours later, I came back to look at her, and he said, "Riversigh, still feel my adaptable?
And if I said no, I was grabbed again, and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was a 10.
In occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went into the room, and I was running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At first, I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it and smiled, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, pulled up the room, took me out of my hand and said, "Go Brian. We are going to be the two."
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside, and he said, "River, I'll tell you something, but you can't tell anyone.
I said, "Okay, Mama."
She said, "Now let me don't do it." I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been watching you."
And I said, "I think you're special.
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "I just want you to promise three things, Bronx."
I said, "Oh, Mama."
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is you always want your mother."
Abban: "She is my daughter, and you have to promise that always the career."
As I loved my mom, I said, "Yes, Mom, I'll do it."
Then he said, "The second thing I want you to do is you will always do the right thing as the right thing is the hard thing to do.
I thought about it and I said, "Yeah, Mom, I'll do it."
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to do is you never have alcohol.
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yeah, Mom, I'll do it."
I grew up in the field, in the rural South, I have a single year older and a younger sister a year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a six beer package -- I don't know where I took them, I would grab my sister and me and went to the forest.
We just came up with the usual madness.
He took a beer support, offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me.
I said, "No, no, no. Okay. You go, but I'm not going to take beer.
My brother said, "Come on. Today we do it, and you always do the same as us.
I took something, your sister too. Take a beer."
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can follow.
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What do you happen? Take a certain."
I kept looking at it with strength and said, "Oh, I'm not going to be thinking about the conversation with Mama."
I said, "But what are you talking about?
He said, "Mom, you tell all the grandchildren that are special.
I was disappeared.
I have to admit something in front of you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this will be widely distributed.
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a alcohol.
I don't say this as a virtue. I say it for the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that they really don't see it.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe to be able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all of his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been standing during the programming.
My uncle died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to her, we should be engaged with.
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different than it was 40 years ago.
In 1972, there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there are 2.3 million.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration -- in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black communities, they find so much desert, so much despair, determined by these facts.
One in three black black income between 18, and 30 years is in jail or medical freedom.
In urban communities across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Balaway, Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all color people are in jail or in parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is much better if you're rich and guilty than if you are poor and innocent.
It's not guilty.
And it seems like we feel very quiet.
The fear politics and the future make us believe that these are not our problems.
We're disappeared.
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work for some pretty curious development.
In my state, in Alaska, as well as other states, you get them from rights for always if you have a criminal condition.
Right now in Alabama, 34 percent of the black male population has lost the right to vote.
And if we project it over the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights is going to be as elevated as it was before they would learn the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where kids of 13 to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, no possibility to get out.
Now we're in process of some literature.
The only country in the world.
I represent people in the death corridor of death.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
So in a sense, have you taught us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for commercially committed crimes?
Very sensitive question.
But you can think about how we are in our identity.
There is another way to look at it, it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by committed crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by error.
From every nine people who are executed -- they identified one that is innocent that it's excited and released from the death corridor of death.
A rate of error, amazing.
This is interesting.
In aviation you wouldn't ever be allowed to pilot airplanes if every nine that you would expect, you would be structurally.
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this matter of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about African-American history, I talk to you about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted to the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a time defined by the terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being linked.
They were worried to be bombardized.
The threat of terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come up with me and tell me, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell talks -- makes speeches speech. Tell people who stop saying that in our history we have for the first time with terrorism, after 111.
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism continued -- obviously, with the segregation and decades of racial surface and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we historically have done.
All the time we collide with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about race. I think it's because we're not willing to engage ourselves with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome racial legislation without a commitment with truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death penalty lectures.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's pretty much wrong to hear what you say.
Adap: We have no death penalty in Germany.
We will naturally never have it here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There's no way with our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we are, intentional and unfortunately, we would put people to execute people."
So reflect on this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, would run people, especially if they were mostly Justice?
We couldn't tolerate it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this description.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult issues, positive and wonderful things are, however, implemented.
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology. We love creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are excited by suffering, abuse, degradation, marine.
In my opinion, you need to integrate both things.
We just talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the designers, the ones that will never get to TED.
Think of them is, in a way, something that is inside of us.
It's true that we need to believe in issues we haven't seen.
So we are. Even though it's so rational, so complicated with the intellectual thing.
With creativity, creativity, development comes not just the brain ideas.
These things come from food ideas also for heart conditions.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just brilliant and underground, but also in the dark and the hard.
Vacling Harvard, the great chef leader, talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering the oppression -- we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, guidance for the spirit, a willingness to be in despair sites and be testing."
Well, that orientation for the spirit is practically in the heart of what I think, that still in communities like TED, should be engaged to us.
There is no relationship related to technology and design, which allows us to really be human if we don't pay the attention to poverty, to exclusion, to inequality.
Now, I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
Let's find them.
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa Parks.
These women were just gathered to speak.
Occasionally, Mr. Carter called me to say, "Rice, comes Mr. Parks. We are going to meet to speak.
Do you want to come and listen to them?
I would say, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she said, "Well, what do you do when you come from?"
I said, Listening to them."
So I went and I just listened to them.
It was very very seriously, very complete.
And in an occasion, I was there, listening to these ladies, and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and he said, "Now, Bran, let me be that idea of equal justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help the ones who have been understandable unfortunately.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice management.
We try to end up with life sentences without parole.
We try to do something about death penalty thing.
We try to reduce population in prisons.
We try to end the mass entirely.
I gave it all my best speech, and I looked at me and he said, "I love Mommy mimage."
And I added and "hearing "upset: very deadly."
At the time, Ms. Carry leaned up, put his finger in the face and said, "That's why you have to be very but very valuable."
I think the TED community has to be much more valuable.
We need to figure out how to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand that every one of us is higher to the worst we have ever made.
I think that's true for the whole world on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to it, not that it's a leg.
Even if someone kills another, it's not that it's an assistance.
So I think there's a basic dignity in people who must be respected by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that many parts of the opposite is justice.
And finally, I think even though it's very dramatic -- very beautiful, very stimulating, it's not going to be judged by our technology, because of our design, not for our intellectual or rational capacity.
At the end of the day, the character of a society, not in the way they treat rich and powerful and privileged people, but in the way they treat the poor, the convicted ones, the prey.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand really profound issues about what we are.
I feel unfortunately. I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
It's tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reasoning in a very important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been sentenced with a lot of distribution.
I go to jail and I see my 13 and 14 years old, who have been trained to be judged as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what is not it?
The judge was able to be able to be adult, but I see a child.
A very late night I was awake thinking. For God, if the judge can become something you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yeah, Bran, the judge has magic powers.
You should ask some of that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working in a cook.
I had a 14-year-old client -- a small one, black black.
I started working in cooking, with an embarrassment that said, "Moral so that my 14-year-old black client is treated as a privilege plant of 75 years, executive of a corporation."
In the kitchen, I put that there had been that there had been a constant discontent in the absence of the behavior of police and in the process.
There was an amazing line on how this country is not there, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that instant motivation would be a dream, or really wrote?
For my horror, not only did I have it, but I had sent it to the cut.
About two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally I decided -- my God, I have to go to the court for this stupid case.
I went up to the car, and I felt truly aggressive, overwhelmed.
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and personally.
I finally got away from the car. I walked to the judge.
I was going up the stairs when I met a bigger black man, and it was the advice of the jury.
When he saw me, she came up and said, "Who is you?
I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "Is you a lawyer? I said yes.
And so I got stuck and hug me.
And I get up in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of you."
I have to tell you now that that was very significant.
That connected deeply with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audience room.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Steve, you wrote this bad monitoring?
I said, "Yes, Mr. Iran, and we started discussing it.
People started coming in. They were all indicators.
I was the one who had written those nuts.
They came up with the police for the polices -- the authorities.
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and we were talking about race because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the balance of the eye I went to see the consensus that was going and came.
He looked through the window, and he was able to hear all that scream.
I kept walking down here and there.
Finally, this old black old black came into the room and sat behind me, almost on the lawyers table.
About 10 minutes later, the judge made a recession.
During the course of the algorithm was offered because the consensus had entered the room.
The assistant is about the old black.
And he said, "Jimital, what do you do in the audience room?
And the black black stood up in foot, I looked at the assistant and he looked at me and said, "Come into this room of audience to tell this young man who keeps his view in the target with financial."
I've come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we can't be truly evolved if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is bound to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and entertainment and creativity must lead to fraction and compassion and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that you keep your view in the target of fire.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You just heard and see a desire desire of the audience, of this community, to help in your purpose, to do something.
Something that's not a crash. What can we do?
BG: There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a refrigeration of this spring in which a effort will be done to retreat the funds that are currently spending in the punishment policies.
For example, here in California, they're going to spend a billion dollars in death penalty over the next five years.
And despite the fact that 46 percent of the cases of homicide are not content in arrests.
56 percent of the rapes don't get to nothing.
Here's an opportunity of change.
This refrigeration is going to propose that these funds are destroyed to make the law, to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation is said that it has to do with the highest embarrassment rate.
What would you say to those who think that is?
BG: Actually, the rate of crime with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growing growth in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's by the wrong war against drugs.
That's why it emerges this dramatic increase in the prison population.
And we left to convince the resilience of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the perpetual chain, to steal a bicycle, by small crimes against property, instead of getting those resources back to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of crime and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment is nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: Bruno, you've been excited about today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter Diamonds: These are just some of the clips that I got over the last six months. They could usually be the last six days or over the last six years.
The idea is that press means prefer to provide negative news because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can process.
And as nothing matters to us to survive, the first stop of all of that data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called angiogenesis.
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the danger detector.
It ordered and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a dozen stories, we will rather look at the negative.
That old adage of the press, "If there's blood sand, it's very true.
And because all digital devices provide negative news seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, not to extract that we are pessimistic.
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be bad at worse.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get distance.
Maybe the huge progress done in the last century for a series of forces is accelerating so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problem: climate change, species extinction and water scarcity and energy. We certainly have them.
As human beings, we are very good at advancing the problems, and in the long end of them.
So let's look at it in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life is more than doubled -- average income per capita per capita has been tripled around the world.
Child mortality has been reduced 10 times.
Moreover, the cost of food, of electricity, transportation and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles Kennedy that global literacy went from 25 percent to over 80 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we continue to get higher and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
Think about that, today, in America, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators, television, mobile air, air and cars.
The barrel magicians of the cat of the past century, the planets on the planet would never have dreamed of such luxury.
supporting a lot of this is technology and lately its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that was going on in technology technology is going on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubled price performance in about 12 to 24 months.
For that motivation, the mobile phone that you have in the pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time, in war and peace, in receiving, depression and in sugar.
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop to any of the big challenges.
And although it's recorded in a law on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is itself faster and faster.
And on this curve, the Moore's Law, there are a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computer in the cloud, that my friends from Australia call infinite computing, sensors and networks, robotics, 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, the fuels, the vaccines and the food, the digital medicine and the African medicine.
I mean, how many saw the victory in Jefferson de Washington: IBM?
It was piametrate.
I looked for the newspapers the best headline than it would be.
And I loved this one: Watson sells human opportunities."
Jefferson is not an easy game.
I play with the mathematics of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available to everyone in the phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called Singapore University.
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how they can use to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we ask them to deliver a company, or a product or service, which can potentially affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people today.
Thirty years ago, that would have sounded absurd.
We can just point out a dozen companies that you've already done already.
When I think about creating abundance doesn't mean creating luxury life for every single room on the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that that is scarce, and it's going to make it unlikely.
You see, the scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of National 11 middle of the 1800s.
He's the guy on the left.
I invited the king of Simon.
Napoleon troops ate with dolphin covers and the same Nazi, with gold covers, with gold.
But the king of Sam -- I ate a aluminum of aluminum communities.
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet -- more than gold and platform.
That's why the tip of the monument to Washington is alignment.
You see, even though aluminum is 80 percent of the Earth's mass -- it doesn't come as a pure metal.
It's tied by oxygen and salaries.
But then the electron came and made the aluminum so cheap that we used it as if it was disabled.
We project this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet based for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
You get to the Earth 16 energy therapies every 88 minutes.
It's not about scanner, but accountable.
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, solar energy cost in India is 50 percent less than the one of the generator generated by dilemma, eight rupees versus 17 rupees.
The solar cost cost 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the sunny parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents per hour compared to the 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have energy abundance we also have water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan put up the Voyager Space spacecraft, in 1990, after Saturn passed Saturn?
It took a famous picture. How did it call it?
"A pale blue dot.
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered by 70 percent water.
Yes, 97 percent is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fight for five percent of the planet, but also here is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the non-government, the normality.
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators of the Algerian -- I'd like to share with you, I was allowed to do that -- his technology called Stanford -- maybe you know it, is the size of a small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water to the day of any water source, polluted water, a letter -- for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just agreed that to do a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes well, and I have a full confidence that it will be, Coca-Cola will implement it in 2006 countries on the planet.
This is a potential innovation by this technology that exists today.
And we've seen it in the mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world in the late 2013.
Think about it, that massive warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And by counting with an intelligent smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance and communication abundance that nobody could have predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of GPS dollars and hundreds of thousands of GPS -- video video, images of books and music -- medical diagnostic technology, now they're destroying and losing market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes when they take health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Colombia Foundation called the X Clark Criminal Prize of 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the team of the world to combine these technologies in a mobile device that they talk about, and because it has A.I. -- they can tolerate -- they can extract blood from the finger.
To win has to make better diagnosis than a certified medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the mortality charge is 25 percent, and there are 1.3 percent of health workers.
When this device sequence a virus of RNA or DNA that doesn't recognize -- to call the health care and, first of all, prevent the pandemic happening.
But this is the largest force to produce a world of abundance, though.
I call it the billion in increase.
The white lines here are the population.
We just had seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against demographic explosion is to draw the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds have never been joining the global conversation.
What would these people want?
What would you do? What do you want to have?
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars injected in the global economy.
And they will get healthier thanks to the Trace, of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of using 3D printing and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three million more members of humanity, educated health and productive health?
How about the voices ever before head?
What if we give the oppressed. wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and be able to act for the first time?
What will you get these three billion billions?
What if they're contributions that we can't do?
One thing I learned with the X Prize is that small teams -- guided by their passion with a clear goal, can do extraordinary things, things that they only could do the great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called Foldgench.
He emerged at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino and figure out how to fold the protein.
Players determine structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a supermarket problem.
They've played with these college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started playing it.
And it's shown that the recognition machinery of human patterns is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that today we have more power as people to assume the big challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the crowded innovation.
We have the capital of the technology.
And we have three billion new minds that are going to join us to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few extra decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very small idea.
It's the behavior of the point of participation.
And as the idea can explain in a minute, before I give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in 1834.
Maybe they thought I pursue pinetics, but it wasn't like this.
I actually pick fish.
And he described one of them as very common.
It was the mere.
I caught a lot to the 1880s.
Now the fish is at the Red list of the USB.
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're press.
The balls are still saying they follow intact.
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept -- the disappearance of the waist.
Because I was there in 1971 studying a landscape in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could integrate it.
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The gecko was surrounded by palms, and, as you can see, from some manufacturing.
There were the talents of about 20 centimeters -- the black baby thylacine there.
And the fish of this thylacine was very abundant and went through a good moment, so he won more than the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had declined in half.
They killed the five centimeters march.
They experienced a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicated in the introduction of the artist fishing fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, well, he started in 1960 Europe, made a lot of development projects.
The fishing development is supposed to impose countries that already had 100,000 fishermen, to impose the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty ugly -- was called the Mutatation 4.
I went out to fish on it, and we did studies in southern the South Sea, and especially in the Java Sea.
What we captured was something unfortunately.
We captured now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture were spirits, other animals that are at the bottom.
And most of the fish are tiny manuscripts on some of the remains.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then it was removed.
These images are extraordinary because transition is very fast.
In a year, you make a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The bottom goes from being a soft coral, in this case, to be a local.
This is a dead turtles.
They didn't eat them. They were disappeared because they were dead.
And once we captured a alive.
I wasn't still angry.
So they wanted to kill it because it was a good food.
This mountain of rest is what you collect every time you go to an area that you've never caught in.
But it's not documented.
We transform the world, but we don't remember it.
We adjust the starting point, at the new level, without remembering what was there.
If we generalize this happens something like this.
On the axis and we have good things -- biodiversity -- birthday, the beauty of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with nature.
Each generation will use the images received at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and excited it forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the substance of changes.
And at the end of the end to keep some other missions.
And that, largely we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer about what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when the predatory societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant -- before you get extinct, it's very often.
You don't lose abundant animals.
You lose little frequencies.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous sea of big fish.
They become unrealistic because we fish.
Over time, there's a few fish, but we think that's the point of participation.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, we don't know that it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, question that it was very different.
And you will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them present, like they capture such and such as a lot of fish in this area can't be used or usually not use the scientists, because it's not scientific."
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in industrialized societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
Hence the huge paper that can make a protected marine zone.
Because with the protected marine areas, we really remember the past.
We remember the past that people can't conceive because the score point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision that I provide, which allows them to erase their departure point.
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like people in the Middle West for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a Shaman Bay simulation here.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in Charlet Bay, 500 years ago.
And you have noticed that math and the tons are like Adamin."
And if you think about Adamin," if you think about why people were touched with the film -- without talking about the story of Pollencent, why are they going to be committed with images?
Because it evolved something that, in a sense, it's lost.
So my recovery, the only one that I'll give you is Cambridge, to make "A "Do It II underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin Lolan, the YouTube trends manager and I look at YouTube videos in professional form.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why videos become viral and what important that is.
We all want to be stars, celebrations, singing, comments. When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today the web is making any of us or our actions, or of our actions.
Anybody can be made on the Internet in a sanitary.
They're over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And from that, just a small percentage is made viral. It gets infinite of vision and cultural moment.
So how does that happen?
Three things: trends of trends and communities of participation and surprise.
Okay, let's start.
Beau Vasles: Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
Holame, guide."
KA: Last year, Betty Valley published this film outside his house at the Yosemite National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the reproductions in the police rise last summer.
Beare is not proposed to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double bow.
That's what you do if it's called YouTube Mountain Beare.
I've already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy Kimber.
Jimmy Kimmer published this Twitter that would catch video to popularity.
The trends of trends like Jimmy Kimmer presented us things new and interesting and disappearing to a wider audience.
Rebecca Blackbot:  It's Friday --  -- you have to start the Friday end.   Everybody wants to get the end of the weekend.    Everybody wants to get the end of the weekend.     Voice, I'll be able to see --  KA: You won't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
"Looks at Redow Black is one of the most popular videos in the year.
It was almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Like "Army greeters double: this video seemed to have come out of nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, you know, it's true.
And if you ask those other pictures, they're also Friday as well.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday here?
Well, it took Maston, and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. Nelson from McKedle Science Theater was one of the first people to make a joke on the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends are adopting and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great inner joke then start talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 parasites of Virgins in YouTube.
In the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the American entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon by telling them or doing something new with that.
Niger Cape is an acceptable animation with an agreed music.
That's like this, that's it.
This year was seen about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a three hours version that has been seen four million times.
Even cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity I woke between the Internet tectonic community.
There were remotely.
Somebody made a version to the old one.
And then it became international.
Suddenly, it came up with a whole computer community that made this happen from being a silly joke to something that we all can be part of.
Because today we don't just enjoy, we participate.
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted "Root Iranian dollars or Red Balkin or Nigerian Cat?
What script could have written that contrasted this situation?
In a world where you get two days of video per minute, just that really unique and unexpected thing can be rid of the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against the cultures to cyclist in New York City, admit that I don't get too interested in it.
Casey Nike: I was moved by not circulation by the biotechnology, but there are often obstacles that prevent you right by the bicycle.
KA: Thank you to the surprise effect and his humor, Casey Nine made five million saw and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth for all the new thing that we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a big question.
Beare Vascologist: What does this mean?
Huhad.
KA: What does this mean?
The trend creators -- creative communities of participation, fully unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines popularity that defines population.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities in the world, Justin Biblick, started in YouTube.
They don't ask permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all kind of masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's barely the media, but they will define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a story.
It's a puzzle that's still broken.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece -- a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a dramatic, a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of his country.
Imagine as the communities come into Sang, the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words for so long, they would be shown now.
It was refugee in silence.
He died blocked by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that be in vain. And my lesson was to learn that the story tried to apply them, but we support it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at the end of a boat delivering quietly towards the sea.
My mother, Ma, was just 18 years old when his father died, and a concentrated marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined to one task alone, the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was incredible for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a four year-old Saturday shell that defies the fiction, a boat goes into the sea of fishing bubble.
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the pirates and rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
If we were caught first, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine, the protest survived in every wave and the straight and vacation horizon.
I don't remember the pirates that came several times, but they were fooled with the men's worth of men in our boat, or the engine dying, and I couldn't be able to run for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who had collapsed and died, to end the journey was too much for him, and the first apple that I tried, because of the men in the platform.
No apple had the same flavor there.
And after three months in a refugee camp, we were in Mellon.
And the next piece of puzzle is about four women along three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in Francisco, a class suburb whose population is common of immigrants on it.
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence I, in Francisco, there was no sense of the right.
The smells that come from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English interact were exchanging among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car shop line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT technology.
We were poor.
All of the dollars were amazed, and established a strange tutor in English and mathematics, no matter what it should be taken, that it was generally new clothes, always was a second hand.
Two media pairs for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to the touches, because it had to last six years.
And there were weird singing and painful over the "ready eyes, and some graphic "students: "The Ashamidiers come home."
home from?
Something in me was expanding.
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to support them."
My mother, my sister and I slept on the same bed.
My mother was exhausted, but we were telling us about our day and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother suffered the baseball, all of the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmare began to be able to wake up.
She opened a computer store, then he studied to be a stable and opened up another business.
And the women came with their stories about men who couldn't do the transition and angry, and influenced, and translated kids trapped between two worlds.
They looked at substances and patterns.
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic Asian student, implanted with what I was demanding from myself.
In the other, it was interested in price lives, tragic to the violence, the abuse of drug and isolation.
But many of them received help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer, I was elected the young Australian young year.
And I was catched from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but his edges didn't fit.
And so read, so Ready, was now so read, refugee and social activist, invited to speak in places I had never heard about, and in houses whose existence she would never have imagined.
I didn't know the protocell.
I didn't know how to use the covers.
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to remove the routine and the comfort of life in an infinite suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, telling me about the day of every one and getting asleep, three still at the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when we went up to the ship.
No one had ever been an option.
"Do it, he told me, and you're not what you don't know.
So I talked about juvenile depression and education and destruction to the marginalized and desperate.
And the more frankly I talked about, the more I was a request to speak.
I met people from all walks of life, many of them doing what they loved to live in the front of the possible.
And although I ended up my license, I realized I couldn't stay in an Aboriginal career.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an oxygen, a recent arrived, new on the scene -- and not only is it okay, but it's something that I'm grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside, it can easily mean to collapse.
I gave enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is destroyed, but not the way we fear.
The possibility that they wouldn't have been allowed to be allowed were tremendously encouraging.
There was an energy there, an implicational optimism -- a rare mixture of humility and value.
So I followed my intuition.
I put a small group of people for whom the motto can be done was an irresistible challenge.
For a year, we didn't have a cents.
At the end of every day, I made a giant wave of soup that we all share.
We worked up until the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant, and we opened up.
He made the decision to move to the United States.
After a single journey.
My correctors again.
Three months later I had moved and the adventure continued.
Before I finished, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time when the Conflict was the social norm and the local Mandela was the person who mattered it.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died after she was born.
The mother raised it alone.
At 17 it became a content of a Mandela whose mother was beating.
Without the support of his husband, it caused a pull to demand it and bring the cause itself, and much more reverse when he won.
The can't make it prove to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the fourth of a hotel in Sydney when she died at 1,000 miles in Melanianatches.
I looked through the market of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to wake up.
My mother called the minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple at Francisco, and we sat around his attack.
We told her stories and we made sure we were still with her.
At night a monkey came and told us he had to close the attack.
My mother asked us to feel his hand.
And I asked the monkey, "Why is his hand hot, and the rest of the body so cold is the free?
"Because you've taken your hand from the morning, he said.
"You haven't sold it out."
If there's a nerve in our family, that email through women.
Given who we were and how life formed us, now we can see that men who have come to our lives would have frustrated us.
The defeat would have embedded easily.
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that to you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, the right.
Can I give you a meadow in your lives, survive brave in every wave -- the constant pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could go and look at it and look at it and look at it.
Travel Neigernes and also the mother of Mount is today, in the fourth or fifth line.
My story begins in Randall about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the street sky, with the singing Muslim Alice.
We were considering how nothing has changed from the time of ancient Indian Indian Marshall."
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to a car and we were surrounding the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
And at that time when Arabic, the great Indian War, he would take a bow. And with a arrow on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with tablets and machines.
The conclusion we pulled out was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a lot of fun.
I felt a little bit more technology.
I was terrified by this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a leading if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't touch my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic to kill it.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his parallel plate of pocket.
And this 50 year-old technology was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of pirate and national parasites in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phones, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent that we go.
They Frank our inspiration.
And so I launched me, I was thrown to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than killing it.
I illustrate books since the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device that was able to connect to the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
We are, where we are.
Put the text together with the image, animation, sound and touch.
storytelling becomes more and more multiplicity.
But what does that serve us?
I'm about to launch Khan, an interactive application for iPad.
He says, "Professor your fingers on every light.
And like this.  He says, "This box belongs ..." I write my name.
And so I become a book character.
In several times I get a card -- the iPod knows where I live through the GPS -- that comes directly to me.
My inner girl is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and drugs but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that we opened children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always came up with me.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad.
And they actually illuminate your way in what you rest from the book.
Another idea that fascinated me as a child was that a whole galaxy is going to be able to hit a ball.
So here, every book and every world becomes a bottle that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book there have always been maps, but they have been static maps.
This is a map that grows up, fluid and guided you during the rest of the book.
At certain points of the book it also gets revealed.
Now I'm going to go in.
Another really important aspect for me is to create Indian content and at the same time.
These are the waste here.
We've all heard of the makers and the ninestocks but how many people outside India know their Indian contracts, the applications?
These poor waste have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and a half pounds.
So we're bringing them back into a contemporary child story.
In a story that deals with current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that kids have been locked up, glued to their Ps -- have not gone into the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of collections, of steams, stones, guards and concerns.
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to recover this ritual of childhood you have to go out and in a chapter -- take a picture to a flower and then label it.
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex, and then label it.
So you create a digital collection of photos that you can then put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a board and says, "Oh, I saw a browser."
A child in India says, "I saw a monkey."
And you create this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been being taken.
Within the range of connection between magic and the Earth and technology there are many possibilities.
In the next book we plant to have an interaction in which you go out with the iPod and the video fires and through the augmented reality.
In a moment, the screen is full of leaves.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and get them to be able to read the rest of the book.
We go into a world where the forces of nature engage with technology and magic and technology closer to each other.
We leverage the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we felt by a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many health projects fail.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University University was to tell a director of the listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she took a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and known: What happens?
"How can we help it?
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of health care is failed because we stop listening.
This is my Wikipedia balloon. It's very simple.
It has a penis and switched off.
Every morning I get up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to 95 feet.
But it's so simple, that every time I connect me, I send my information to Google Health.
And my cancer doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time in which you need cardiovascular assistance or some urgency of that style but look back.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my school block and before I go up to my car, people start talking to me, Luci, today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it is pressure from couples used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be employed to move people from their chairs and together develop some recreational activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week, being available.
This little battery connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people can, from their homes, take their artificial pressure, send them into their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to the control and be captain of their own ship, but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the cost of medical attention, the doubling of demand and other issues.
You can do techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through crowdsourced.
And one of the things we did want to share with you with a video.
We all have navigation control in cars.
Maybe even we have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where the car boxes are in Maston.
It's also where all the gasoline is.
And of course, we can find fast food chain.
But where is the nearest DVD to help this patient?
We asked ourselves, but nobody knew.
Nobody knew where to get DNA saves lives right now.
What we did was we made crowd-applaud in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public, and you see a DNA, please send it, game where, and when it's open, because sometimes they open in office hours and others are closed.
And over 10,000 DNA was already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for Lasha, augmented reality, to find these DVDs.
And every time they are in the city of Maston and somebody else -- they can use their iPhone, and the next weeks to use their Microsoft cell to find the nearest DNA, which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just as DNA 48, which is the name of the product, but also as DNA.
And we want to start it globally.
We are making all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find and work and act as a center for the crowd of the DVD around the world.
Every time you go out of vacation and someone else, it can be a relatives or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us value these DVDs.
They could be service services or phone people, for example, to see if the FDA that's shown is still in place.
Please help us on this and not only improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share my photograph.
Or is it photography?
Because, of course, they're pictures that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest for photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed up with my previous passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was in the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you press the pulse.
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed to me that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the pulse.
So pictures like this: a construction in a very transmitted road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of real.
Or pictures like this -- dark and colorful at the same time, but with the common goal of keeping the resource level.
And when I say that I say photography.
Because, of course, it's not something I can capture but I always want it to be captured in some way as a photograph.
Photos where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea than with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them look real?
Are the details or colors?
Do you get the light?
What does the illusion do?
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But ultimately, it's our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive in a two-dimensional surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here's three perfectly unimaginable objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that still seems traditionally, as if it exists.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's get the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It really is to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem to be realistic I think are those in which we don't even think about, the things around us in our everyday lives.
But by combining pictures is very important to consider it, because otherwise something looks bad.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But combined, you can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos should have the same perspective.
Second, combined photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images with these results, they were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to do impossible to distinguish the beginning, and the end of the different images with a perfect joint.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is.
This is another example.
And I could think this is the image of a landscape, and the bottom is manipulated.
But this image is totally composed by pictures of different places.
I think it's easier to create a place to find it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that you have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as this idea of winter I thought I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
Costs are a different location.
The underwater part was captured in a stone piece.
And yes, I even did the house of the top of the island to make it look more safe.
So to achieve a realistic result I think we need planning.
You always start with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well thinking.
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and it can be very realistic at the same time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
Let me start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can put it.
It's a diagram anyone who took from a folder.
I'm not so interested to show you the details, but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the potential of RSSB microscopes versus the potential of local areas.
What's interesting about this is that this is like many other that we used to see is kind of a straight line in logarithmic scale.
In other words, every step here represents a magnitude order on the performance scale.
Speaking of technology with sexualizing curves is a novel thing.
Here's something weird happens.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn on the lights.
I needed more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we record technological curves in logical scales.
The answer is that if you drew them into a normal curve where we say, these are the years, or some time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I wanted to graph, the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if I graph, for example, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a self-interest would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, you give a qualitative change.
If the transportation technology would move as fast as the microbes of microbes, we could actually take a taxi and be in Tokyo 30 seconds.
But it doesn't move to that rhythm.
There are no precedent in the history of technological development of a remarkable growth that every few years old orders of magnitude.
The question that I want to plan is -- looking at these exponential curves -- we see that they don't go forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
It will happen one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical cut I know like this until it gets something completely different, or maybe doing something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, that's why I think maybe something like this.
From being so, we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line, we are in a transition of what used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask is, and ask me, is: What is that new way that adopted the world?
What new state is the world directly?
Transparency seems very, very confusing if we're immersed in it.
I remember that the future happened in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been embedded, year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is happening.
We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different that we are doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition that we experience.
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and I.T.
Because I think the only way to understand is to take distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale I would like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we took about 2.5 billion years when the Earth was a great sterile rock with many chemicals that float around them.
If we look at the way that we organize those chemicals we give us a sense of what things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin with RNA -- I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is, at that time, there was a bunch of oil droplet with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate the materials of the outside, and so the droplets grew up.
And they started dividing.
In a sense, those were the most primitive cell forms -- those oil droplet forms.
But those droplets were not alive, in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random check of chemicals.
And every time they divide a dramatic distribution of the chemicals that they contained.
So each cat was a little bit different.
In fact, the droplets that they somehow became better about the time of incorporating the surrounding chemicals -- they grow more chemicals and they divide more.
They usually lived longer. They were more represented.
It was a form of life, chemical life, very simple, but things got interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some ways that we don't understand all of these droplets that they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemistry called DNA.
In other words, they worked in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to replicate with.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to be stable from that they evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for fun. Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 milligrams of white dust that I try to hide people in the airport security.
But it contains -- I took this code, the code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this DNA fragments, and I amplified it 10 to the 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of for all the present -- in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a ground I would have put it in a virus and I would have spread it through the room.
What was the next step.
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years.
But then another big step of interesting step in which things got very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information by forming cells of cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can swap DNA.
So for example, for example, they evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and prepare them to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there are many resistant resistance, because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that were being formed, in a way, were together in that, and they set up a synthetic.
So they would survive or failed together, or that if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community replicate more and they were failed by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities got so close that, in fact, they joined and decided to write the whole recipe of the community together in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage we have multicellular communities, communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a multi-planting community.
We have a lot of cells that are no longer acting alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart of the heart, or the muscles or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call an organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started to abstract information.
And build very special structures that did not do more than process information in community.
It's the neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they began to specialize within the community being the responsible structures to record and understand and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as individuals, learning was confined to the duration of an organism, not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could be able to learn to not eat some fruit because he knew wrong and sick the last time I ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that they had built these information processing structures that have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system builds those information structures enormously accelerate the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most refined version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a vague idea, in your head.
I'm sitting here emitting some groups and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and conflict, in his heads that saved certain analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated we turn it into sound, in sound sequences and produce something very complicated in another brain.
That is now allowing us to start as an organism.
In fact, as a humanity, we've started doing abstract.
Now we go through periods similar to multicellular organisms, we abstract our memories of record.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The phone -- the computer, the video tape, the CO2, the CO2, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that makes us much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microscopes.
You saw the evolutionary executive of TED in which it produced some evolution with the Confidence program, to our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales over again.
The first stages of history that I told them took a billion years each.
The next stage, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The following, language and so on, took less than a million years.
And the next one, like electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is remarkable. I guess that automatic is the right word to name something that accelerated its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we look at in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process interviewed.
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that I job to design them would not be possible without recent computer advances.
But now I design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to design them in a conventional way.
I don't know that it makes every transistor in that connections machine.
There are billions.
Instead of that, with the designers of Thinkient Machieson -- we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that could not be done before, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it employs methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microbes.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve.
We say, "Please computer, can you run a hundred million sequences of instruments of all?
Could you run these sequences of instruments by random, to execute all those programs, and take those who are more approach to what we want to do?
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more close to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random settings of instructions. They order numbers, so none of them got it.
But one, luckily, could put two numbers in the right order.
And I said, computer, could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that you better did the task done?
We save those and we eliminate the rest.
And now we reproduce the ones that are best ordered by numbers.
And we came back to play them by following a process of relative reconciliation to sex."
We take two programs, which are children who are engaging subjects, and kids inherit the properties of both program.
So we got a new generation of programs from the programs of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the process."
Call back again.
It introduced some mutations to them.
And it tries again to try again with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that order numbers of absolutely perfect ways.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze you to see how they work.
These are dark programs, strange programs.
But they take the comet.
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depend on achieving it.
I once went in a 747 with Mark Minister, and he pulled up a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, "This airplane has hundreds of thousands of participants who work together to offer a safe flight, and it doesn't make you feel transplant?
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make good design processes.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole options that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make a lot faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
So it's remarkable.
Things go faster and faster and so I think it seems so confused.
Because all these technologies are feedback.
We are dropping.
And we are at an analogous moment to the single-celled organisms when they became multiplication.
We are the embassy, and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant about our thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of whatever comes from.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'll stop here before I get rid of it.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've wasted enough time to let me close part of my fake bias on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the end, the World Wide Server.
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about to go out "Romania, talking about the statistics and using them to form a big baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know it.
It's called battery average.
And we talked about 300 of a battle that killed 300.
That means that baseball batteries effectively, three of 10 times.
That means launching the ball to the game field without being attached, and that anyone who tries to launch it to the first base -- it doesn't come in time, and the second base will be saved.
Three attempts of 10.
You know how they call a 300 battery in the Great League basis?
Well, really good, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a Balackett baseball of a 400?
By the way, that's somebody that 10 boards, it takes four.
Legacless, like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the Library of Basolo to execute more 400 hits in a regular season.
Now let's bring this to my world from medicine where I feel much more comfortable or less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have appearances, and you're derived to a surgeon that has also a 400 record record in operations.
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a loved self has two observer coronary arteries and their family doctor delivered to a cardiologist whose ancient in angiogenesis is 200 dollars.
But you know what?
She's getting this year.
They have been 251.
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you think should be the average of action of a heart surgeon or orthopedic surgeon or a nurse or a gifted obstacle?
1,000 very good.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in all the medicine knows a good surgeon or a doctor or a paradox.
What we do, though, is to send them into the world, and they include me, with the manager of being perfect.
They never, ever make a mistake and worry about finding out how to do it right.
That was the message that I absorbed when I was in medical factor.
I was a computer observational student.
Once, a fellow in high school said Brian Goldman was studying until a blood test.
That's why.
I was studying in my little device, at the TEDster General Hospital design, not far from here.
And I learned all memory.
My kind of anatomy, I memorized the origin and muscle work, the branching of every arteries that comes out of the air, the diagnosis of hard hard and the non-violent.
And I even knew the digital diagnosis about how to classify kidney turbulent.
And the more and more knowledge.
And I went very well. I graduated with honor.
And from the medical school with the impression that if you memorize everything, then you would know everything, or the most possible thing -- close to the whole thing, because this is what I would get involved from mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs.
I was a university in a university hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought Mr. Drug to the emergency service where I was working.
At the time I was assigned to the cardiac service.
And when I applied to a subject to a cardiologist I got to attend to that patient.
And I'm going to report the chief of residents.
When I saw Mrs. Drama was standing down.
I heard a solar sound.
And when I announced it, I heard a shark sound on both sides, which gave me a consistent heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working, and instead of pumped the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, these are full of blood, and that's why there's difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to diagnose it.
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I would give him.
He gave him aspiration and medication to alleviate pressure in his heart.
I gave him diagnostics, water pills so that he could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started to feel better.
And I felt great.
And that's when I got the first mistake, he sent her home.
Actually, I made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of resistant.
I didn't raise the phone, and I did not do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and put it with him to see her.
And if my boss would have seen her, I would have been able to get a lot of complex information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that required constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take responsibility that I could take care of my patients without even contact to my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner who said, "Golden, it's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so insecure that I was asked for the nurse to take care of Mrs. Drug did you think it's okay if you go home?
And the nurse thought, and then he said to total nature, "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if I were yesterday.
And so he signed up the height, and the ambulance along with the paradigms took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, I had a bad presence on the stomach.
But I followed my job.
At the end of the day, I packed to leave the hospital and walked into the parking where my car was to go home. At that time, I did something that I don't normally do.
I went through the emergency service at home.
And there is another nurse, not that discussion of Mrs. Drug before, but another -- he told me three words, those three words that most of the medical emergency doctors do.
Other specialists are afraid too, but there is a particular in emergency and is that we see patients as well.
The three words are really really?
"Do you remember the patient that sent your house?
I asked the other nurse with total nature.
"Well, she came back, with the same voice of voice.
She was fine.
But I came back and on the edge of death.
At the time of an hour of having arrived at his house, after I gave him the high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called at 911, the paradoxical particularly brought it into emergency with an artificial pressure of 50 miles of High, which means a severe shock.
I barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff is despite all its resources.
They gave him medication to climb the artificial pressure.
And they put an artificial breath.
I was complicated and headed to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the establishment was in intensive therapy and waiting against all hope that would recover.
And in the two or three days that I would never wake up.
He had an amazing brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they went back to what was happening.
And to the ninth day, they let it go. Mrs. Drug Drug, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The next week, I punish for it, and I experienced for the first time the bad shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt alone, unlikely, without feeling that healthy shame because you can't talk to your colleagues.
You make the peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The evil shame I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that that we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that feeling.
And it wasn't because of my boss, he was a love.
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I suffer things and make sure that they wouldn't give me.
And I kept asking myself those questions.
Why didn't I ask my boy? Why did I send her to his house?
And in my worst moments, why did I make a mistake so strange?
Why did it choose medicine?
Slowly that feeling was displaced.
And I started to feel better.
And on one day, he opened the sky and finally came out the sun, and I wondered if I felt better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I was reflecting the efforts to be perfect to make no more errors, I would take those voices off.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was helped in the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I got a 25 year-old man with a pain in the throat.
I was very busy.
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her throat -- he was a little collaborator.
He gave him penicillin and sent it to his house.
But as he turned to the door he kept pointing his throat off.
Two days later, when I came to make my guilty change, my boss asked to talk to me in his office.
And I put the three words, right?
Remember the patient he saw for a pain in the garden?
Because he went back and didn't have a strategic fertilizer.
He had a potentially deadly effect called electricity.
You can find it in Google. It's an infection, not the garden, but the upper airline goes and can cause the close of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, it didn't fail.
It is anticipated by anti-alike and record to the few days.
And you went through the same shame and reproduction period, then I got stuck and I returned to work, until again and again and again.
twice in the same emergency tube, not diagnostic applications.
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it takes 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a discovery.
One of them thought I had a genuine calculation of it.
They ordered a rate of kingdoms, but it turned out normal -- a colleague that was checking the patient was a certain sensitivity on the lower right and called the surgeon to the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
They ordered him liquid to retire and asked my colleague to review it.
You checked it up, and when you noticed some sensitivity in the lower right-hand side, I called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and recovered well.
But every case I was attacking me, I was depressed.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a purpose.
The most significant ones have been over the last five years.
It's just embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't release and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the voice that tells me what really happens, how could I share this with my colleagues.
How do I teach them that they don't make the same mistakes?
If I went into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure.
Of course in a party you hear about other doctors, but you won't listen to somebody talking about your own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a triangle in my hospital employed the wrong leg, believe me that I would have difficulty to look at it in the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The full denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two positions that make mistakes and the ones that don't sleep and the ones that are -- those who are having a result and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction, like antibodies that begin to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we go from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of discussion and medical journalism, I've made a personal study of bad medical prisoners and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the State Toronto to my program, "When Content Coast, Blake Art "Anthronomolity, black art."
And what I learned is that mistakes are optimistic.
We work in a system where mistakes are happening every day, where one in 10 drugs prescribed in the hospital are wrong, or disaster is not right, in a system where the interactive infections are increasingly more, and more numerous and getting chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24,000 Canadian penguins for average medical mistakes.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000 dollars.
In both cases, it comes about burning subsidies, because we're not tearing the problem as we should.
And that's how things are.
A hospital system where knowledge is multiplying every two or three years, and we don't update us.
The sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a pain in your chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain on the chest, come up with lunch eyes and with alcohol and all of a sudden, and my story is a disappointment.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a robot -- I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't relate their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as they taught us, and we eliminate all the professional professionals to error, well, not to stay anybody.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their cases more great?
In my program, "Delt World, black art, black art -- it's my worst mistake -- I would tell everybody, this is my worst mistake. I would tell everybody, this is my worst mistake, blah blah blah blah blah. What are your mistakes, and I run the microphone to them.
And their students would stop, they would go down, and they go down and they would start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You want to be able to say, "Look, don't make the same mistake.
They need a context to be able to do it.
They need a redefined medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The redefined doctor is human -- human knows, accept it, and it doesn't get embarrassing from its mistakes, but it's effort to learn from what happened to teach others.
It shares your experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
It pointed out the mistakes of other people not with trying to attract them, but in a loving and supportive way for everyone to benefit.
And I work in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings are going to direct the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes occasionally in the time.
My name is Brian Goldman.
I'm a redefined doctor.
I'm human, I make mistakes.
And I feel a lot but I was effort to learn something that can convey others.
I still don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: I remember it.
You know how many decisions we take a day anyone?
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
Recently, I made a survey to more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that say to pick an average American. It's about 70 a day.
Not long ago, in a research followed for a week to a group of business presidents for a week.
The researchers recorded the different tasks that are driven by these executives and the time they used to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, they take 130 jobs a week.
Naturally, every job involves a lot of ministers.
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent took an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many they belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of a time in the hour?
How do you calculate the way that you make those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the moment, to choose to the options of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When you ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give a palm.
And now my first question of the day, are you ready to hear about the problem of the operation of options?
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, often this very, very high supermarket supermarket -- at least at the time it was very sophisticated.
It was called Dreams.
It was almost like going to a amusement park.
There were about 250 different kinds of mustard and vision, more than 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the background -- and this was when we took water from the graph.
I loved to go to that store, but in an occasion, I asked myself, why would I never buy anything?
This is the olive oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in the sealed box that came from military trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I said, "Do you work this strategy of offering all these options?
He pointed out the buses full of tourists that came up with every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to make a little experiment with med.
Passenger.
They had 38 different classes.
We installed a post for giant, just to the entrance of the store.
We put up there of six flavors or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what are people willing to stop to stop the metabolic?
More people stopped when there were 24 percent, 60 percent, that when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a memory torture.
Here's the opposite effect.
Those of you who stopped when it was 24, only three percent came to buy medical.
The ones that stopped when there were six, we saw that 30 percent of them bought med.
If we do the math, people had six times as likely to buy memorized if they found six, that if they found 24 they were found if they found two.
Well, deciding that we don't buy it probably being convinced -- at least it is good to preserve the line, but it turns out that the problem of choices of choices are affected to us in really momentous decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this doesn't convince us.
Now the theme of the day, the financial saving.
I'm going to describe you a study that I did with Switzerland Hungari, Emit Kamanie and the West Jane, where we looked at the savings of the savings for about a million Americans -- from between about 650 planets of this country.
We were interested to see whether the number of funds available in plans of savings for retirement -- the 404 program, developed people to save the future.
And we discovered that there was a correlation of it.
We had 65 plans that were going from two to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding offered -- there were less participation.
So if you look at the extreme extreme, we see that on the plans that offer two funds, the participation rate was 70 percent or more, not as high as it would like.
And on the plans that offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more options, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger the number of options, the more people were inclined for avoiding action or investment funds.
As soon as there were more options, they were more willing to invest in the financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we would recommend to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing to do is they put the decision, that they apply it even when it goes against the interest itself.
They are more likely to make the worst decisions in the finance and in the health.
They are more likely to choose less satisfying things, although they obviously go better.
The main reason is that we go to look at that giant variety of mammals, mustard and vision and memorizing, but we're not able to do the calculations to compare and control and choose that awesome exhibition.
Today I want to propose to you four simple techniques that we've tried, in one way or another, different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is, Cortion.
You have heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than more.
People always bother when I say, "Corrector."
They care about losing space in the adaptation.
But actually what we're seeing increasingly is that if you decide to cut cut, get rid of strange redundant options, there will be an increase in the winds, will be down the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When Project & Gamble went from 26 different types of Health & Shakespeare to 15, they saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the cooperation Gordon Cat removes the products for decades of cats that were left -- they increased the uses in 80 causes, by two causes and less contents and less expensive.
You know that the supermarket of today, on average, offer 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store they offer about 100,000 products.
But the world's largest stores in the current world is Alec and offering only 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato tomato sauce guy.
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have emerged on how to manage better the choices is David Lanka, the Harvard program.
All Harvard employees are automatically embedded to a safe insurance fund.
Those who are really willing to choose -- they are offered 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how to cut it.
They're all important choices.
The first thing I do is ask the employees, "Tell me the differences that are between those options.
And if your employees can't difference, you will not be able to do your customers.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with Gary with Gary with.
He told me that I would be willing to offer people from this audience with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a description here.
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to read it, and then I want you to give an applause if you're ready to take Garry office.
(Audience plants." Okay. Anybody who's ready to accept the open.
Aren't they more?
Okay, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that journey?
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first round than in the second one, than in the second one, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the supply of options, which is Congo.
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences have to feel very alive to be very completely.
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when you use debit cards or credit cards than when you use effective career?
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out that making it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with Shanghai Benegoide and Seattle Prevention, on staff of IIMA who worked at NIH, these people were in a meeting where they were affecting a 404 plan.
To that meeting, we thought exactly how it was used to it, we made a little addiction.
What we added was that we asked the staff to think about the positive things that happened in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this minimal there was an increase in the affections of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their savings accounts from four percent.
The third technique is Clail.
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a magazine hall.
We saw that in the Webning supermarkets along the North corridor, the magazine exhibition can contain from 335 different types to 6649.
But, you know?
Because the classification indicates me how to tell them.
These are two geometry shows.
One is called Jack and the other, "Synergy."
If you think the on the left is Synergian and the on the right is Japan, you give a palm.
(Music places." Well, there's a few.
If you think the on the left is Jack and the one on the right is Synergi, give a palm.
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is Jack and the on the right is Synergi. But you know what?
This rating scheme is totally useless.
categories have to indicate something to hide, not what defined them.
You often see this problem with those huge funds of background.
Do you suppose who you are information?
My fourth category, Connecting complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than we think, if we just simplify it a little bit.
We need to increase complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a very complicated decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allows you to do it completely.
You have to take 60 decisions, to grab the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offer each one.
Color outside color, I have 56 possibilities.
engine, boxes of change, four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order in which decisions appear.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, a few boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from few choices, four boxes, to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to look like?
How much you are.
If you take it always the button per definition in every decision, this indicates that they're overwhelmed or it's being losing them.
And we found that the ones that go from many options to a few options -- they operate the button over and over and over again.
We lose them.
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
Same information, same number of options.
The only thing I did was to alter the order where information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to scale.
Although the school box is not saying anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
It excites us a product that we are building that now has more hooked with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the operation of options, Cortiee, eliminating strange alternatives -- Congression, make it real. We can handle more categories with less options -- conditions complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help drive alternatives or better for you, to use them in their issues, or for people who are serving them.
So I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful to scanner.
And the more carefully we are in our best choices, we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1980s, in the East East Germany, if you had a writing machine that had to record to the government.
I had to register a text sheet, written with the machine.
And this is so that the government could track the origin of text.
If you found a desk with the wrong message you could trace the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we didn't conceive that someone could do this, how much that would limit the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer of any large manufacturing and print a page, that page will end up having some yellow yellow dots in every page that makes them a pattern that makes them themselves and their printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can address attacks according to their attacks.
There are three main groups.
They're the circuits.
Like Mr. Dimitry Golf of the city of Kirtternel, in Ukraine.
The mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cybercriminals to earn a lot of money, enough amounts of money.
There are really many cases of online millennia, multiplicity, who won money with their attacks.
This is Valley Tasksons, of Tora, Stein.
This is Alfred Goldish.
This is Stephen Watson.
This is Borne Sound.
These are Matthew Anderson, Tario Alzheimer's etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their forests online, but they do it for illegal media translations using banking trains to steal money from our accounts when we buy online, or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy in an infected computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, froze the Swiss account of this lady, Sam Jane, and this story had 14 million dollars when he was frozen.
Mr. Jane walked out of supermarket, and he takes his stop.
And I say that today is more likely than any of us are victim of a cyber that is a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes from bad at worse.
In the future, most crimes will happen online.
The second group of impact in importance that we observe today is not motivated by money.
There's another thing that moves them, they motivate the protests, they motivate the opinions, they motivate the laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have discovered in the last 12 months to occupy a role in the attacks online.
Those are the three main attacks," the criminals that do it for money, the hackers like Anonymous who do it to protect and the last group are the national states that they attack.
And then we see cases like Dignity.
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
Digital is a certified authority of the Netherlands, or, actually, it was.
Let me tell you the last hole because of a shadow.
They had the security of the site and performed a cyber.
Last week, I asked, in a meeting with Dutch government representatives asked one of the leaders if they were talking to the death of people because of the attack to Digital.
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die, because of these people?
Digital is a certified authority.
They sell certified.
What do the certifies do for?
Well, you need if you have a website with hits, extractive services SETI, services like Gianistan.
Except that you will intercept a certified certified authority.
And they emit cartoonister certified.
And in the case of Digital happened exactly that.
And what happened in Arab Spring, and those things that have happened, for example, in Egypt.
Well, in Egypt the protesters took the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April in 2011, and during the budget of the building, they found a lot of paper.
Among those papers was this cartoonister called "The HIV/AIDS.
And within that portfolio there were notes from a sea company in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 250,000 euros to Egyptian government.
The company headquarters is right here.
So Western governments provide tools to the totalitarian governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, the Scott School was found -- a tree used by government government officers to investigate his own citizens.
If you're suspection in a good criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is intervention.
But today it goes beyond today.
The Internet connection.
They even use tools like the Science train to infect our computer with a disorder to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these obvious response should be a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm a honest citizen.
Why worry about it?
I have nothing to hide.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's at stake.
Privacy is not discussing it.
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right we're going to do today, will be forever.
Are we blindly confident in any future government, in an administration, that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you need to worry about over the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, at the south of Nairobi National Park.
These are the cows of my dad at the bottom, and behind the cow, the National Park.
The Nairobi National Park has no closer in the most part of the south, which means that wild animals like the balls migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, follow them, and this is what they do.
It kills our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we got back in the morning and found it very bad because it was the only bull we had.
My community, the masses, we believe that we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to put them, and that's why we value them so much.
So I grew up hate the lions.
The dying is wars that protect our community and livestock and they're also upset with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there is so few in Nairobi National Park.
A child in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for his father's livestock and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions would give them fear.
But I realized that actually this doesn't serve because it even helped the lions to see the statement of away.
I didn't give me up. continued.
A second idea was to use a spiritual.
I was trying to deceive the lions to think that was near the stage.
But lions are very clever.  They came up with the first day and saw the spiritual, and they went back, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So they jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the stage with an torch and that day the lions didn't come.
I discovered that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that I would lose and turn out the lights.
And this is a small lamp of a broken flashlight.
I argued everything.
As you can see, the solar panels load the battery and the battery supply electricity to the little indicator box. I call it a transformation.
And the indicator box makes the lights detail.
As you can see, the light bulbs go outside, because that's where the lions come from.
And that's how lions see when they come from night.
The lights are developing and choose the lions to think that I'm walking through the stage, but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You put them. You can see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now throughout Kenya, to scare other predators like hells, leaders, and it's also used to spread elephants from the farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship on one of the best schools in Kenya, Brooklyn International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and focus.
I even led my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to put them.
So, one year ago, I was just a kid on the parasites of my father's savings, and I used to see flying airplanes and I was telling me that someday would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to be engineering and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions but now as my invention is saving my dad and the lions, we can be with the lions without any conflict.
At smell -- what in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't imagine how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you get a scholarship -- Richard Turkey: Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one?
LT: My next invention -- I want to do an electric fence -- CA: An electric close?
RS: I know that the electric fences were invented but I want to do mine.
CA: You try once, right? And you. RS: I've tried it before, but stopped because I got a salary.  CA: At the foot of the county. Richard Turkey, you're a big thing.
We're going to encourage every step that two, my friend.
Thank you very much. RS: Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No English stuff."
And I felt very proud of it.
In school, we spent all the time studying the story of Kim Sirico, but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan is the enemy.
But sometimes I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed all of a sudden changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister's colleagues.
That said, "When you read this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the past two weeks.
We are recorded together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak. We're ready to die."
I was very strengthen.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child climbing in his arms looking at his mother's face without being able to do anything.
No one helped them, because they were very concerned about caring themselves and their families.
A huge famine, to North Korea in the middle '90s.
In the end, over a million Koreans died during the famine and only few survived eating passenger, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more prevalent the energy cortex, all around me was completely on dark at night except by the lights of the sea in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to neighboring countries.
This is the Amoshy River, which serves from boundaries between North and China.
As you can see, the river can be very ancestor at certain points, allowing Koreans to cross secret.
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of the famine I was sent to China to live with distant patients.
But I just thought I would be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to go back together.
In China, it was hard to live like a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be as a Norwegian refugees.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because Norwegian refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants in China.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was revealed and it would be represented to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was reality, when I was arrested by Chinese police, and I was interested in the police station.
Somebody had accused me to be normal, then they examined my skills in Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was terrified.
I thought my heart was going to blow up.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and spontaneous.
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
At the end of the interrogation. It was a false report -- she's not normal."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some norms in China are looking for asylum.
But many can be arrested by Chinese police and depressed.
These women were very lucky.
Although they had caught them, they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These norms were not so lucky.
Every year, North Koreans are captured in China and sports to North Korea, where they're tortured or imprisoned or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to escape, many other Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, the whole world can be tortured in an instant.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to risk myself going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
Going in South Korea was a much larger challenge than I expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We are all coral, but in the inside, we've become very different because of 60 years of divide.
You even bring up a crisis crisis.
Am I a surface or a northern system?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call with pride me.
Even though to adapt to the life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan, I started studying for the extension of income to university.
Just when I started to adapt to my new life, I got a so-called algorithm.
The North Korea authorities introduced some money that I sent to my family, and as a punishment -- my family was going to be displaced to the force to a floating location.
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
The Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and I walked into the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to guide them, somehow for over 3,000 miles across China and then through the South Asia.
The bus trip took a week, and we almost got caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by a Chinese police officer.
He asked all of us, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, it was implicated and I told him that they were supportive people who were comparing it.
I looked at me suspectionalized, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the Laboratory border.
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe border guards in Labs.
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned to cross the border incredibly.
After paying crutches and sounds, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and imprisoned again in Laboratory capital.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close, but my family was retreating in prison at a short distance of the South Korea.
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribe.
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man asking, "What is the problem?
I was so surprised that a stranger would be important to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without doubt -- the man went into the ATM and I gave the rest of the money for my family and for two norms and put them out of prison.
I thank you with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I help me?
"I'm not helping you, he said.
"I'm helping the North American people.
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The love unknown a new hope for me and for the North Korean people when we needed it.
And I showed that the kindness of the unknown, and the support of the international community are actually hope rays that the North Korean people need.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But the freedom is just half the battle.
Many norms are separated from their families, and when they go to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from international community with education, practical language practices, working practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us remain in contact with families still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very lucky, I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help normal giving Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more Koreans transmitted around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Southern Center.
This is Central South Center, stores of little food, fast food, ballets ballets.
So the city planners got together and they thought, we're going to change the Southern Center name to represent something else, so they changed it to the South Angeles -- as if this is fixing what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles of limits, fast food, ballet food.
Like 265 million other Americans, I live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center, home for food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the meals of food to get more people killing more people than food in the car.
People are dying of cure diseases in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, Beverly Hillis -- which is about 15 miles away.
I get tired of seeing that this happens.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if they didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they go out of house see the harmful effects that the current food system has in their neighborhood?
I see chairs of wheels bought and sold as cars used.
I see center centers like Starbucks.
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
You also tired me to drive 45 minutes of age and go back to buy an apple that doesn't have any pesticides, which I don't have any pesticides, you know.
What I did, I was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a land row we call a garden.
It's 45 feet three meters old.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me in win, because it's my responsibility and I have to keep it."
That's how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green Grouses, we got together and started planting our food forest for food trees -- fruit trees, you know, nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we are kind of a group paid for a lot of profits of all the processing, all over the city and completely volunteers, and everything we do is free.
And the garden was beautiful.
Then somebody complained it.
The city came up to me on top of it, and in summary, they gave me a cartoon saying that I had to remove my garden, the Catholic became a logical order.
And I said, "Come on, really?
A court order to plant food on a piece of land that no one matters?  So I was like, "Well, let me get it."
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve Louis, and I talked to the concrete and one of Green Grouses members who put a petition in Channel, with 900 signatures, we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My partner even called to say that they were responding and loved what we were doing.
I mean, let's go, why not?
L.A. is the U.S. city with the most ballet threats.
It's 68 miles of ballet terrain.
That's about 20 Percent Parkinsons.
That's enough space to plant 750 million tomato plants.
Why don't you see this?
Film a plant will give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of holes will give you 75 dollars of result.
It's my hypothetical, when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
Cutting your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for Central south.
I grew up there. I raised my children there.
I refuse to be part of this manufacturing reality that was manufacturing for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The garden is my graffiti -- I grow my art.
Just like an artist of graffiti -- that we promise walls, I promote soils, gardens.
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my employ of that canvas.
You would be surprised to see what the land can do, if you let it be your canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing a giant is and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness of how my garden became an education tool, about transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We're the land.
They were surprised to see how kids affect kids.
The garden is the most therapeutic and provocative act that you can do, especially in a cruel.
Also, they get cold.
I remember an occasion, which came a mother and his daughter, were like the 103 percent of the night and they were in my garden, I went out and looked very likely.
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, they don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, "Finance, don't you fear that people are going to steal your food?
And I say, "Oh my God, I don't fear you will be shoulder.
That's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it, but in turn, I want you to remove your health.
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a refugee shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, which helped me download the truck.
It was fabulous. I was shared with his stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant with his mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed them, so it was just for a moment.
So Green Grouses has come to plant maybe 20 parks.
We've had, like about 50 people who come from, work and participate, all on voluntary plan.
If kids grow color, kids eat color.
If none of them grow tomatoes --  But if none of these are taught -- if none of these are taught if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and body, you eat blind people in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they are stuck. I see color kids that are on this path designed for them, that they don't take them nowhere.
With the garden, I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are commissioned from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington Canade.
But if we don't change the composition of land, we'll never do it.
Now this is one of my plans. This is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole square of gardens, where people can share food in the same square.
I want to take content and turn them into healthy coffee.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free things, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability is you have to sustain it.
What I'm talking about is to get people to get people out of the street, and they know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening farming markets.
What I want to do here, we have to do it sexy.
I want you all to become ecological renewables, gesture, managing gardens.
We have to change the script of what a management is.
If you're not a garden, you're not a gesture.
That managers take their word right?
That is your choice weapon.
In sum if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, they don't call me if they want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some shit, to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your word, so you can plant something.
Peace peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
(Music noises)  You probably all agree with me in which this is a very nice road.
It's made of station, and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it has a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that you save.
And especially if you go into your bike and these cars go by, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can do a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we want a silent career.
The solution for that is to make perfect paleontologist roads, right?
The pore shot, a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has dogs and water can go through it, so all the water is flowing up to the sides and will have a road that it's easy to drive, and they won't save any more.
The noise will also disappear in these pores as well.
Because it's very holy, all the noise will disappear -- so it's a very silent road.
It also has disaster, of course, and the downside of this road is that you can disappear.
What is it to disappear? You see that in this road the stone stones come out.
First one stone, then several more and more and more, and so on, and then you can do that.  But you can give you your windshield and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bacteria with that.
Oh, that's ready.
Basis, of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how the damage comes in this material.
It's a porous, like I said, so it only has a little amount of teenagers between the stones.
Because of the interpretation, to the ultraviolet light, to orthopping, this advertise, this bottom, the glue between the roots, is finding, and if you get together, you will do microscopes and get separate from the additional ones.
So if you drive on the road, you get the additional ones, as you saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about artificial materials.
If we can make this material around, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel landscape, from that to clean savings, and we can cut the steel lines into very small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the button.
So we have a shareholder with small pieces of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to cook -- a computer machine.
The industry can heat up, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, melt the button, the button will flow through these microbes and the stones will be attached again to the surface.
I used a microphone oven, because I can't bring the great computer machine here to the stage.
The microwave hormone is a similar system.
I put the sample, which I'm now going to take to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
So we tried many samples there and then the government, they really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try it."
So they gave us a piece of roads, 400 meters from the AIDS highway, where we had to do a test cart to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the road test, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples of this road and test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of charge in them, we repair them together with our industry machine and we repair them and we would test them.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using steel fibers, including these fibers using the energy of information to actually increase the life of the road -- actually increase the life of the surface -- you can actually save the life of the surface, and you really save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to face first before I can show you how it acts the repair act.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woke up one morning with the sound sound in my house.
My father was listening to ABC News, on his little gray radio.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because news usually depressed it.
"The Taliban were going to be raised my father.
I didn't know what it meant, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school right?
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban came out of Afghanistan and they made illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was seen as a child to sculpt my older sister who could no longer be outside to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could educate them.
Every day, we took a different route so that no one could support where we were going.
We had to hide the books in the market bag so that we were going to buy them.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us who are stuck in a small room.
It was nice in winter, but extremely hot.
We all knew that we risk our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every once in a while, the school was crazy for a week, because the Taliban were suspended.
We always wondered what they knew about us.
Were we following us?
Did you know where we live?
We were amazed, but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was appreciated and the daughters a test.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total inconvenience of a remote province of Afghanistan, insisted that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father repeated it.
But my education became a teacher.
This is her.
It will retire two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of all his family in receiving education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the Taliban.
For him, there was a greater risk not to educate his children.
Over the years of the Taliban. I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated by our life, and I was always scared and didn't see a future.
I wanted to quit, but my father said, "Hey, my father -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can force you to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So still want not to continue to continue.
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the bankers, and if my family had not been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here proud to graduate in Milomonian College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was exiled from his home for the brave of educating their daughters, was one of the first to congratulate it.
He wasn't only stopped by my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who took it through the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
That's why I'm the global ambassador of 111, a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded SOL -- the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls going to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, as the month, advocate for them, despite them, and even in front of a destructive opposition.
Like Amazon. It's not your real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
It was less than a month ago, he and his daughter were going from South SOPA to his village, and literally, they escaped to be killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When he arrived at his home, they were the phone, a voice was told that if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would come back to it.
"Meet me, if you like, he said, "But I won't give the future of my daughter for his old and retroverse idea."
What I've realized in Afghanistan, and it's something that's often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of us succeed, there's a father that recognized the value of his daughter and that he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they are the first compelling intersections of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the Taliban -- the girls who went to school turned into hundreds -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
And I found that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I fear that these changes are not a lot, after the retreat of the U.S. troops.
But when I come back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who advocate for them, that animals, I see a future promise and a lasting change.
And for me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities, and every day the girls of SOPA remember it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the example: "Harac, resist Gaddale. struggled against him.
But you never get a Gapper state revolution."
They've spent almost two years since I climbed the liberal revolution inspired by the baseball of mass movements both of the Tunisian revolution as well as the Egyptian revolution.
A force with many other light citizens inside and out of the country to call a day of farm and start a revolution against the Syrian regime of Gapable.
And we succeeded. It was a great revolution.
Women and young liberal men were in the land, demanding the fall of the regime, carrying participants of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a value to be able to explore the dictatorship of Gadible diagram.
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the East East to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a six months of brutal war and a loss of about 50,000 dead loss, we managed to release our country and defeat the torture.
But Gaddal left a heavy hair, a turment of tyranny and corruption and alternative seeds.
For four decades, the Syrian regime of Gapper destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral society of the liberal society.
Conscious of the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted, along with many other women, rebuild liberal civil society, demanding an inclusive transition and right towards democracy and national reconciliation.
They were established about 200 organizations in Bengoin during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi, about 300 in Tribaging.
After a 33 year-old period, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about developing capabilities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the Platos of Women Lab by the Peace -- a movement of women, leaders, of a very diverse orientation, to advocate for the social autonomy of the woman and for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace.
I found a very difficult environment in the prefrontal period, an environment that was increasingly pollution, which is moving from the selfish selfish and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won 17 percent of National Congress in the first election in 52 years.
However, the power of elections and revolution as a whole, were disappearing. Every day we found the news of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of ancient mosques and Sufi tumors.
Another day he was threatened with the news of the American Embassy and the consumer attack.
Another day we woke up with the news of the architecture of the army of army.
And every day, every day we wake up with the government government and their continuing rape of human rights and their lack of law respect.
Our society is shaped by a revolutionary mindset, and it has gone away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
The intolerance, the exclusion and the revenge.
I'm not here today to inspire them with our history of the critical list and the elections.
Rather, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, we choose bad, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The criminal list and alternative between candidates and candidates brought peace and national recognition?
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still polluting and dominated with selfish policy policies and exclusion, both for men as a women?
Perhaps what was missing was not just women, but the female values of compassion, miserable and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion
Our society needs national dialogue and creation of consensus more than choices, which only reinforce polarization and divide.
Our nation needs the quantitative representation of the female to need the numerical and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as an image agents and calling the Iranian days.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and missionary.
We need to develop a female speech, which is not just honest, but also put the mission in practice instead of the company, the collaboration instead of competition, the inclusion instead of exclusive.
These are the ideals that a Libya, destroyed by war, desperately need to achieve peace.
Because peace has an acceleration that is about interview and alternative between female perspectives and males.
That's the real criminal.
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it solving.
According to a versus of the Koran Saluat Paela, it's the word of the Middle God, "Get "Good Compassion."
At the same time, the word "Archive, which is known in all the academic traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word "Reading -- symbolic and maternal -- that would take all the humanity that men and women -- that all tribes and all the peoples have embedded.
And so, just like the uterus covers the embryo, which grows in, the divine matrix of the normal compassion of the whole existence.
So he says, "My missionary stopped all things.
This is what it tells us, "My mirror prevents about my grass."
They were all given to the missing of the mission.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about an intriguing question, which has an equally intriguing response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everybody does always, why is she left?
Why was anyone going to stay with a man who personally personally?
I'm not a psychologist, no social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I had just license at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in Sevender magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green American Excels, and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I created my twin soul, I would hit my head with a pile, loaded with a pile of grass.
The man I loved more than anybody in this world, I put a gun in my head and threatened with killing more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of "color love -- a psychological trap. Harvested love, where they drop every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a super-immersive subtle of domestic violence.
I'm a license in English at Harvard University, and I have a MRI in marketing from the Washington Business School, Shakespeare.
I've spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo Burna and The Washington Post Post.
I take almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black labore and a mental Hong Sweden.
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all the religions, all the retirement and education levels.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of malaria are men, and the domestic abuse only happens in intimate relationships and independent and long duration or, in other ways, the last place where we want or hope to find violence, motivation for which, domestic abuse is so disappointing.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be with a man who pays him, and I actually went very typical because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other age, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples and ninestorms and abusive husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, his warning signals or their patterns.
I met Congo on a cold and rain night of January.
I was sitting next to me in the subway in New York City and started to float with me.
And he said two things.
The first one was that he was just licensed from a University of the Invent Life and worked on a very important bank in Wall Street.
But what struck me most about that first was that it was smart, and it seemed like a kid in the field.
I had a little bit of big molecules like apples, and a wheat sub-sub-ship hair and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things he did Congo, from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it above the beginning putting on a penguin.
We started coming out and loved all of me, which was ready, that I had gone to Harvard who put passion to help teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know it all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
Congo believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as anyone had ever done before.
And that's why the license in that prestigious school and work in Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is to be seduced and making the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is to isolate it.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was go from New York City and leave my dreams, but I thought I had to make sacrifice for your partner, so I accepted my job and Congo, and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a crazy love car, which was entering a physical trade, financial and psychological translator careful.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it react to it.
And here's where those pills go in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where Congo had to feel so safe to buy three psychologists.
I had it in the car garden.
Another daycare underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those psychologists because of the trauma that he lived in a little bit.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those pills were actually a message for me, and although I never raised my hand, my life was already in danger -- every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of Congo happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and still had the camera.
Five days later, when the 10 engines of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's wedding suit and married me with him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we would live happy for always because I loved him and he also wanted a lot.
And I was very, very strange.
He simply had felt very abundant by the wedding and the fact of forming a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I would never be hurt.
I spent twice in our honey moon.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and lost me, and he gave me so strong in my head that I stole in the head of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon, was drowned by traffic, and I threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
Congo continued to take one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was wrong when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of every three American women is a domestic violence victim of domestic violence in some point in their life, and the Centers of Disease Control that every year 15 million children are male -- 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
So going back to my question: Why did I left?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, fell in love with a profoundly attracted man, and it was the only person in the world who could help Congo face their demands.
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just marry it?
Why didn't I leave, I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and most painful question that people do, because we, the victims, we know something you normally ignore -- is incredibly dangerous to abandon a male.
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is to kill it.
More than 70 percent of the murders in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has gone to the relationship, after they married, because then the abuse has nothing to lose.
Other reporters include the permanent bear, even after the adult has gone back to married, density of financial resources, and the family of the family system of family to land the victim and their children, who are usually forced by the judges to spend time not supported time with the man who was paying their mother.
And yet we keep wondering why it's simply not going?
I was able to leave, because of one last passionate satisfying that I saw my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, I would have killed if I had allowed it.
So I broke the silence.
I told everyone to the world: to the police, to my neighbors, to my friends and family, to full unknown, and I'm here today because all of you helped me.
We have the tendency to stabilize victims like spectacular televisions, self-destructive women, damaged goods.
The question, "Why is it left?
For some people is a way to say, "The fault is your for "extended -- as if the victims are going to choose to fall out of men who want to destroy them.
But since I published "Lough Love: I've heard stories of stories of men and women who were also scanned, that they learned an amazing lesson of what happened to them and redember their lives lives and joyful lives as employees, wife and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out, actually, I'm a victim and a very typical domestic violence survivor.
I went back to marry with a tender man and love and we have those three children.
I have that black laboratory and also that dot.
What I'm not going to come back to ever have ever more, but it's a cardioven pill pointing to my head in the hands of someone who says he wants me.
Right now, they're just thinking, "Hall," that's fascinating." or "Hah, what dumb was, but all this time, I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being materially matched, or they were so small or being used themselves.
The male could be affecting his daughter, his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love to particular love breaking silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse is only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence just throwing light on it.
The victims we need around the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They take the male to light talking about it with their children, their work, their friends and family.
They rethink their view of survivors as fantastic people and lovely people, who have a full future.
They recognize the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow their scale and show the victims a safe output.
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the safe and peaceful obstacles that should be.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russia, and for a while, I'm a model.
To be accurate, for 10 years.
And I feel that right now, there's an uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not be dressed in this way --  luckily, I've brought clothes to change me.
This is the first clothing shift in a TED stage, so you are very lucky to present it, I think.
If some of the women were horrified when they came up, they don't have to get it right now, but I will find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what they think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These guys are very uncomfortable, less than I don't have to use it.
The worst part is to spend this guy on the head, because it's when they're going to laugh from me, so they don't do anything as I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also surface.
I've totally changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I never had a girlfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would take the back, and it would take the hair out of the kid.
Of course, I save surgery or an artificial broken like the one that made me two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, even though superficial and inspiring, has a huge impact in our lives.
So today, to me, being valid means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a beautiful and white woman, and in my lab sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do me, but I would feel like that.
The first question is, how do you become model?
And I always say, a cataloger discovered me, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became model is because I won the genetic literature, and I'm the benefit of a heroin, and maybe you're wondering what this wound is.
Well, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to admire -- we also associate it to a high and selective shape, to feminist and white skin.
And that's my heritage -- the heritage that I've known to harness for money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now scanning spectacular, and maybe there are some lovers of the fashion that they say, wait. There are Naomi Toron, Toron, Joan Senson, Billy Wen.
First of all, the happy to know so much about models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York City told each of all of the models in the runway, and from the 77 controlled models, only 27 -- that is less than four percent, were not white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Could I be model when it's up?"
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't love that.
But then, what I really told you to each of these girls is, why? You can be what you want.
You can be president from the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a nice night and poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first.
If you have this spectacular list, you're still inspired, no, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my boss, I know.
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the redefine chief of American Voice magazine or the executive director of Homotale, or the next Steven Messar.
To say that the older you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you get bigger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike cardiac surgery, it can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've got your studies, and you have a curriculum and you work on your back, no matter what you say, if you want to say you want to be president from the United States, but your curriculum said, model of internal clothes for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are retreating.
And yes, virtually all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that they took me, and also the first time I used a biological, and I didn't even have my period yet.
I know we're entering the personal land, but it was a girl.
This is what it looks like with my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
So here I am in a panel party a few days before the photographs for the French Voice.
So here I am with my football team and I saw in V.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are creative of a group of professionals, profits, machines, photographers and statistics, and all of their aid people and pressure people are able to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: Do you get things free things?
I have too many taxis of 20 inches and I never use, except the previous couple of privilege, but the privilege that I get in life are the ones that I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free vessel.
When I was a teenager, I traveled with my friend who was a driver piece, and he jumped up a red service, and of course, they stood up, and I went back to it, agent to keep driving on.
I enjoy these privilege privileges for me, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect of no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, from the 14,000 teenagers that I stood up and received, 86 percent were black and Latino and most of them were young men.
And there are only 1775, young black men in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of mind?
But how many times would I stand in? And when do I go?
When I was researching for this talk, I learned that 50 percent of the 13-year-old girls in the United States in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes to 78 percent to 17 percent.
So the last question that people ask me is: What is life of a model?
And I think the answer you expect is: If you're a little bit more thin, and you have the most brilliant hair, you will feel very happy and great.
And behind the camera, we give an answer that maybe it looks like this.
We say, it's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible can be able to work with creative people, ingenuity and passionate people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras -- what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever asked, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair, will be happier.
You just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most thin legs of legs -- the brightest hair and the more in fashion -- but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest benefits.
If there is something to go back from this talk, I hope that everybody feels more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image of perception that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since it was larger enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 most precious photos -- and I didn't know who I took them.
There were no artistic directors, no stations, no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a minimum care in the lighting edge.
In fact, most of them get them out of the random tissue.
My story begins when I find myself in New York City to give a lecture, my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the 57 and five community.
He gave the chance that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to New York to New York in a dad trip and you continue the ritual?
This is when we started asking the tourists to get us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has denied it, and fortunately, nobody has ever fled with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much life this journey would change us.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after 9/11, and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day so a five-year-old girl could understand it.
These pictures are much more than a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October, and to be able to reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because even though we always get the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter can reach new hypothesis, and I can see life through his eyes and how it perceives and interacting with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the trips we were walking on, when suddenly he stopped dry and pointed out a red trip from the wrist store that I was looking at little visits before.
And I described what I'd been five years old in that same place.
I began to remember his heart beating with force when I first saw that place nine years ago.
And now what I look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created are memories.
So I want to share the idea of engaging actively in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't get out in many family photos.
I'm always the one who pulls up the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and they don't doubt to get someone and ask them, "Did you get a picture out of it?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The Bhutanese are in the most threatened birds.
First of all, why are they so bad press?
It's also associated with Disney laughter, like mental characters, stored, stupid.
More recently, if you've been following the pink Kenyan press and applications and academics -- these are the attributes that you associate with the Kenyan Parliament. But I don't accept.
I don't accept. You know why?
Because Parliament members don't keep the environment.  The parallels don't help prevent the spread of disease.
They're hardly monitoring.   They're far away from excited.  And my favorite, the sharks have better presence    There are two kinds of bumps on this planet.
There are the New World tribes that are mainly found in the Americas, like corps and cards, and the old World Bases -- where we have 16 species -- from these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the Bhutanese important? First of all, they provide online ecological services -- limitation.
It's our natural garbage records.
They clean the caves up to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They help to absorb the anthrax that not being for them would spread and cause large losses of livestock and disease in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no banks, the cadavers take three to four times more time in democratizing, and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
The Bhutanese also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient Egyptian culture.
New was the symbol of the protein and the material and, along with the copper -- symptoms the unit between the United States and the underwater.
In the Indian mythology, Natasha was the Burt god, and he risked his life to save the daughter of 10 Randala devil.
In the Tibetan culture, they do very important people to open sky in places like Tibet. There is no place to bury dead or wood to create them, so these tribes provide a system of natural eliminating system.
What's the problem with bunchunities?
We have eight species of bunch in Kenya, which six are in extreme threat of extinction.
The reason is that they're being invented, and the reason they're being poisoned is because there are conflicts between humans and fantasy.
In Southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of bunch are on critical list of endangered danger, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old will be extinct, and the reason is because they fall from the consumer consumption that has been treated with an analog drug like Dicket.
This drug has been banned to use veterinary use in India and have taken a position.
Since there is no Buddha, there's been a spread in the number of street dogs in cave vegetables, and when you have street dogs -- you have a huge carbon bomb bomb -- the number of rage cases have increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind parks in Africa, 350 agencies are going to be up the Turkey lake.
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
These are birds of birds.
In Western Africa, there is a horrible trade of dead bunch to serve the barber and the factories market.
So what is it doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're putting them transportation.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so focusing on a local problem is not going to be aware of anything.
We have to work with governments on the regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about learning the bunch, about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services they provide.
How can you help? You can make noise. You can make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them we have to focus on these very understanding creatures -- donate their time to spread the word.
When they come out of this room, they were going to report them on the bunch, but they talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors with their neighbors.
They are very elegant. Charles Darwin said he changed the opinion because he saw them fly without effort without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do profoundly -- it's been shaped for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
And since 1971 to 1977, I'm young, but I'm no longer --  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa of Marian, Argentina and Somalia, in the technical cooperation projects with African countries.
I worked for Italian NGO, and every project we set up in failed Africa.
And I was permanently.
I thought, at 22, the Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we played we analyzed it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "World "American "Architects, was a project where we decided to teach people from Zambia.
So we come with Italian seeds to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the Zambia River, and we teach local toxins to grow Italian tomatoes and calables, and ...
But of course, people were not at absolutely interested in doing that, so we paid them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't go --  We were amazed that local locals, in so fertile valley, had had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible to be crazy -- we just said, "Thank God we are here."  Sweeney: "In time to save people from the Hamburg of the Hamptor."
And of course, everything in Africa is collected.
We got these magnificent tomatoes -- in Italy, a tomato is going to grow this size. In Zambia, this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the ships, "Look at how easy the agriculture.
When the tomatoes were pretty, markets and red, overnight. At night in the morning, about 200 hypothesis appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the shames, "My God, the "Holy "Heart."
And the ships said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't they say it?
I thought we just made the Italian mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what English did, what the French did, and then seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the hypothesis.
You should see the waste --  You should see the waste of the people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read "Disk Moore" from Damorian Moore, and we have a light economy.
The book was published in 2009.
We Western donor countries, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that the money has caused it.
Just read their book.
Call it from a African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are imperatives, collective missions, and we treat people only two ways -- or we are patternalized or patterns.
The two words come from the Latin Ratin root Rate, which means parent."
However, it means two different things.
Patient, I treat any of a different culture as if they were my children, "I want a lot of you."
Pattern, I treat all of a different culture like my services.
That's why white white is called "Babylon, boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face -- the small thing is beautiful -- written by Schramia, who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be help, delivers alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is to respond.
This morning, the gentleman who opened up this conference put a cane on the ground and said, can you imagine a city that isn't neuroscientist?
I decided at the age of 27 years of people, and I invented a system called Company Facebook where you never start anything, but it becomes a serious of local passion, the service of local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? You get quiet.
It never gets to a community with an idea, and it sits with the people in the local school.
We don't work from offices.
We met in a coffee -- we met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we figure out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give somebody an idea.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And so we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not to do, at once we hear it? But not community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never assume, and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, which opportunity has identified it.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't attend their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face-to-face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family of the company, the family family of the business, which is established with you in your house, on the table of your kitchen, in the coffee table, and that helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a way to make your life.
I started this as a test in Expender, Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this basic junk that we came to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on the march, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it? And I said, "I did something very, very, very difficult.
I shut up and I heard it."  So the government says, "Harvest again."  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs that are dying of solar.
Peter Drug, one of the most great business assistants in history, passed up to '96, a few years ago.
Peter Drug was a philosophy professor before involved in business, and this is what Peter Drug says, "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and an economic company economics."
planning is the kiss of the death of the business spirit.
So now you have Christian rebuilding Christian without knowing what the most autistic people in Christopher want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come up with you.
You have to offer you confidence, privacy, you have to be fantastic when you help them, and then you will be able to go in mass in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion.
What are you going to have applied this morning.
local local people -- that's what you have applied.
So, what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial industrial revolutionary industrial revolution -- and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The sand as a way of holding machines is not sustainable.
What we have to consider is how we nurture -- we cure, educating education, we communicate seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do that.
Who is going to invent the technology for green revolution, universities? Forget it.
Government? Forget it.
It's going to be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a scary story that I read in a futuristic magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to debate the future of New York City in 1860.
And in 1860, this group of people came together, and they speculate what happened to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was the city of New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and pointed out, if population is kept growing up at this rate, to bring it to the population of New York around them, they would take six million horses and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to deal with.
They were already announcing in strange.  So in 1860, they were splitting this dirty technology that would absorb New York City.
So what happened? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared 100 automotive manufacturing, 1901.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absorbed and there were very few scales, scarceles, factories in apartment places.
Debate, Michigan, Henry Ford Ford Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you confidence.
Otherwise, you're not going to come to a conversation with you.
Then, you have to offer them an absolute thing, dedicated service.
And again, you will have to tell you the truth with respect to understand.
The smallest company, the biggest company, has to be able to do three things magnificent -- the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to count with fantastic commercial, and you have to count with great financial administration.
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, selling and looking for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've investigated and looked at the 100 iconic companies in the Carnegie world, Western Western, Edison, Ford -- all new companies, Google, Hah.
There is only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, just one: None of them was started by one person.
I would never say the word "I -- but the word us, 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have factors, who come from a small business environment sitting in capitals, in bars alongside their dedicated desks who are talking about the gentleman who talks about this epidemic, somebody who's going to ask you, what does it need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, can you sell it? Can you look for the money?
"Oh, no, I can't do that, "I want you to look for somebody to look for you?"
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't exchange a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like a self-related, planning and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their approaches?
How can we preserve and ask more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do we share more memories from our abandoned buildings and understand our landscape better?
How do we share our hopes before the empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I'm love in New Orleans.
My soul always finds relief with giant robots that give shadows to lovers and burned and soldiers for centuries and trust in a city.
It's always handled to the music --  -- there's a defense in New Orleans.  The city has one of the most beautiful architects in the world, but also with the largest number of abandoned property in America.
I live close to this house and I thought about how I could turn it into a more enjoyable space for the neighborhood, and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was John, like a mother for me.
Her death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this was a deep gratitude for the living time.
He gave to the meaningful things of my current life.
But I choose to keep this look at this look at my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to let me catch through the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old friends and new friends transformed the wall of this house abandoned on a giant pigeon, and painted on her friendships to completely drive, before he died, I do."
So the transistors could take a chalk. reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations.
I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but the next day the wall was full and kept covering it.
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died I want to be judged by "paragraphy"   Before I died, I want to sit on the label of charge of change."
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a tree.
Before I died, I want to live outside the network."
Before I died, I want to hug it once again."
Before I died, I want to go to the rescue of someone."
Before I died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became constructive and dreams and hope from people made me laugh to cardiac, and they got me wrong, and they gave me dinner at hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and exchanged ways -- it is about giving the responsibility and confident, and remembering what's most important for us as we grow and change.
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we did a kit and now have been made in countries around the world, like Kanknin, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together, we demonstrate the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distributions increasing, it's more important than ever before, finding ways to preserve perspective and remember that life is short and delicate.
Death is something that we often avoid to talk about, or even think, but I understand that preparing for death is one of those things that trust us more power.
Think of death clarify our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care as individuals and as a community and with more media sharing hope, fears and stories, the people around us not only can help better places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request today.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my sisters.
Remo is 22 years old, it's high and very gun.
It doesn't talk about it, but it takes joy to better than some of the best speakers.
Remember knows what love is.
You share it incredibly happens what happens.
It's not advanced. It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
You don't care about the religious differences and focus on this: you've never lied.
When I sing songs from our childhood, trying to provide words that I couldn't even be able to be able to remember -- reminds me one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16. It's high. It's very shadow.
It weighs the most impossible memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
I don't remember if I stole my chocolate, but I remember the year that I came out of each of the songs in my iPod -- conversations that we kept when I was four years old, to make my arm during the first episode of the Telescopes and the Lady Gaga birthday.
Don't you seem incredible?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds are not adjust to the concept of society of society, they're often ignored.
But what drives my heart and fortunate my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they wouldn't consider them within the ordinary thing, that could only mean one thing: that they were extraordinary. Autonomy and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term autism, it's a complex brain disorder affecting social communication, the learning and sometimes physical abilities.
In every individual in each individual in a different way, from there that Remo is so different from Sam to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, you diagnose a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of development that is faster in the world, there's no cause or any known cure.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
I was screaming a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't look very interested in myself.
He was living in his own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing washing and eating anything that would be between media.
As it grew up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evidence.
But beyond beaches, frustration and intrinsically intrinsically hyperbolic, there was something really unique and innocent nature -- a child who saw the world without prejudice -- a human being that I had never lie.
Extraordinary.
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments in which I would have thought they were just like me.
But I look back at things that have taught me about individuals, communication and love, and I realize that they are things that wouldn't want to change for normal.
Now the beauty goes through the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what's right.
If I could convey one thing to Remain and Sam and you would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have. They're a gift. Every one of us has a gift in their inner and honestly, the pursuit of normal.
The opportunity for farmer, progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what should have been to be Alice in the Marshalls country.
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher, who gave a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  Adapt of truth -- scared of these students with his great minds, his big books and their big words and of words.
But when you develop those conversations, I felt what Alice should have felt when he fell down the hole of the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with the students, and I was surprised with the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We need a great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges, from energy to environment and care of health, among others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists having these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not inviting us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please. Give them simple.
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do that to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
So first question to answer us, and then what?
Tell us why science is relevant to us.
They don't just tell us that they study traffickers, but they study traffickers, which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the optimists.
And when they're describing their science, care with the jargon.
The jargon is an obstacle for our understanding of their ideas.
So sure, you can say "particle and temporary -- but why not say space and time -- which is much more accessible to us?
To make them accessible is not the same thing as to make them dumb at all.
Instead, as Einstein said, everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without compromise ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- are ways of charing and excited with their content.
And by presenting his work, forget about the signals of balance."
You have wondered why they're called balls?  What are the bullet baseballs: the bullets kill and kill their presentation.
A film like this is not only boring, but it's too supportive in the language area of our brain and overwhelming us.
Instead, this example of Gene Brown example is much more effective, showing than the special structure of traffickers is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower, really.
The trick here is to use a simple sentence, legislator, that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you provide charts that apply to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what you describe it.
I think these are just some key things that can help us open the door and see the country of the wonders that are science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they have solved this equation, all over the media, make it simple.  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of all the Dictionary English dictionary is "slightly?
Just because it sounds very good.
And "Legal means "population police."
Though there was a newspaper editor of the 19th century who defined it a lot better when he said, "A sensory is that looking for a public charge no matter with it, platform or principle -- and that, when he win, he gets it for the mere use of a remote verb monument monitoring.
I have no idea what reactive means.
Something about words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't until -- for example, 1771 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the parliamentary camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the insect name of Brazil Cross, who faced the Parliament to Parl.
They put him in London Toronto and they locked him, but he had enough courage to face them, and at the end he had such a support in London that won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase "The "brand "Brain "Sunday "The metal."
Most people think it's literature.
It's not. It's by a deposit of the freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, right after the independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a Republican country?
This was defined in Congress for a long time.
All kinds of suggestions were presented that could have failed.
Some of you wanted to call it "The "The Speish of State, and others, "Your Altor George Washington, and others from the Lourness of the United States Looks Listen."
Not very carefully.
Some of you just wanted to call it Ree."
They thought it was a quality of quality.
And not even that they were moving, they had the idea that you could be elected King for a certain term.
And it might have served it.
Everybody gets tired, because this debate was provided for three weeks.
I read a poor sensor -- and I always wrote, "I still have this issue.
What caused the portrait and the until the Republic of Representatives was against the Senate.
The House of Representatives did not want Washington to be able to broke up power.
You didn't want to call it King for whether I gave him or his super ideas.
So they wanted to give it the most modest title and more incredibly important and more kind of local thing that came up with.
And that title was President."
President. They didn't invent the title -- there was already before, but it only meant somebody who owns a meeting."
It was like the president of a joke.
And I didn't have much more granding than the term "a capital or superconductor."
There were the equivalent of the small collective and government pressure of government, but it was really an imaginary title.
And so the Senate is opposed.
They said, "It's ridiculous. We can't call it President."
"This guy has to be treated and meeting with foreign diversity."
"And who will take a series with such a ridiculous and intriguing title as President of America?
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't close.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been the proper of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate to be in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is temporary --  -- we could still wait to wait 220 years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this, I want to leave you, is that President of President in America doesn't sound at all so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to device, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of armed air vehicles and so on.
Reality and history have broken the title of grading.
So I won the Senate.
They got their title of responsibility.
And also the other concern of the Senate, the supply of synthetic -- well, it was a singularity at the time.
But you know how many nations are you present now?
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate won and the Cambridge of Representative Republic, because nobody is going to feel humble when they tell them that they are now the President of America.
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and what I'd like to leave you with.
politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, the reality is a lot more the words than what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to foot in the ground in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded out of heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the rock of sweat bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but mostly that capital of male cough and stones with primitive tools.
Like others, I bring a cheap little cheap of slide to the head with this anger statistic, and I can barely distinguish the branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that fell hundreds of meters on the ground.
It took up my hand, and I suddenly remember a minority that I met days before, who lost control and fell incredible meters into that period.
As I talk to you today, these men are at the depths of that hole risk their lives without paying and reward and often dying.
I came out of that hole and I went home, but they might never do it, because they are pressure of slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 continents in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only exhibition at the Vancouver Peace Cube.
Among all the amazing people I met there met an integral of "Free the Salmans," an NGO that is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not to such a degree.
When we finished talking, I was honestly embarrassed to ignore this activity of our days and thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I was made a name of the stomach, and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet "Free the Salats and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these sites.
Some of them even considered them my second home.
But this time, I would sell the dirty troops.
A conservative calculation says that today there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced throughout the whole deal of transplant slaves.
150 years ago, the cost of an agricultural slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker worker.
It's equivalent to about 50,000 dollars.
But today you can enslave the entire families for generations by ambitious debt, of 18 18-year-old.
Amazingly, slavery generates from more than 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled with false programs of good education and better work and then discover that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and can't escape.
Now, slavery is operating in the commercial: goods produced by slaves have value, but those are discouraged by them.
slavery exists around the world, and yet, it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met brick hormones.
This weird supermarket was like entering the ancient Egypt or the Infinity of Daniel.
Imagine in a temperature of 54 degrees C. men, women, kids, in fact, entire families wrapped on a spine mantis of dust, they stack mechanically bricks in their heads, up to 18 at a time, and they take them from the artists to trucks that are hundreds of meters.
Demonstrating by the monkeys and the song work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There were no pathways for eating or to drink, and the severe statement made it pee out to be pretty interpretation.
And so perfect was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to the touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run into the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to review it, and sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the oven, I wanted to cry, but the application that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "Listen, don't do it. Don't do it here."
And I was very clearly explained that demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer them any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were already gone.
I had to rely on "Free The Salats and work within the system for his release and trust them to get it.
As a result, I hope to get home to feel disappointed.
In the Himalayas, I found kids running rocks for miles for miles to monkey to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big planes were more heavy than the kids who were charged and children put them into their heads with email shells made out of sticks, ropes and harmonthesis.
It's hard to press something so overwhelming so much.
How can we influence something so imminent, but so optimistic?
Some of you don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without pay, because this has been all their life.
They have nothing to compare to.
When these villages picked up their freedom, the scanners burn their houses.
When we hear the word school we often think of sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness I was told that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In Katholia, I was struck in women who had been previously sexually scanned.
And I was driven by some ancient ladder stairs that were giving this dirty basement, and it has fluorescent light.
It wasn't exactly a border.
It was rather a restaurant.
Research as you know in the office, they're local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms, private rooms where women with their girls and children, some of the only seven years, are forced to train customers and encourage them to buy more food and alcohol.
Each dot is dark and dirty -- identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a biomass and a curtain.
Workers often suffer sexual abuse by their clients.
From foot in the penguin, I remember feeling a right acute fear and, in that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be to be trapped in that hell.
I just had a salt -- the stairs.
There were no short doors.
There were no windows enough to climb up.
Those people don't have a school, and because we play such a difficult subject, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual traffic happens around us.
There are hundreds of people who are scanned in agriculture, in restaurants in domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex slaves.
It happens by documentary, but we don't see it.
Texts are another activity that often we relate to the labor of slave labor.
I visited Indian villages where there were some intelligent families in the silk trade.
This is a family portrait of family.
The black hands of black are the father and blue tissues and red hands.
They mix title on these big barriers and dip the silk on the liquid to the elbow, but the texture is toxic.
My introduction told me his stories.
We don't have freedom, they said.
We still hope, though, being able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay us our work."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake Volta, the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fish family in a ship, two older brothers, some younger children, makes sense right?
Wrong. They were all scared.
Children are separated from their traditional family, disappeared and forced to work outside to work extinct on these boats on the lake, despite the fact that we don't know to swim.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat was approached was temperately, he feared that his little canoe was an ambition.
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The branches of the trees emerged in Lake Valley often attracted networks and children, fatal and fear, they take water down to unleash the branches.
Many of them are blocked.
Since I remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love, it's not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruel crossing, it brutally deals with the younger slaves under its marine.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they were lifted up the latest networks, but they had been working from a single one.
at night and version.
And it tends to point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're full of fish.
I want to introduce you to Kowler.
Kofi was rescued in a village village.
I met it in a refugee where "Free the Salats recorded the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes the possible.
Who will become because someone decided to make the difference in their life?
Considering by a road in Ghana with "Freel States Society Southern Salamas, a company with his motor suddenly accelerate and support our car and touch the window.
It asked us to follow it for a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the road, he invited us to come out of the car, and asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed out this little bit visible and said, "This is the path, and this is the way. Go!
As we started down, we removed the interviews that blocked the way and after walking about a hour we found that the path was attached by the recent rain, so I put the photo team on my head as we descend in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of truck, the symptom path was overwhelmed in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and they were all filled with school workers.
A lot of women had children tied to their backs, and as they were looking for gold, they were walking in water sent with market.
The market is used in the process of extinction.
These minerals are enslaved in one place somewhere in Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were pregnant in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, irritated eyes, because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits have up to 90 feet and these people load heavy baggers that then will be transported to another area in which they will be transported to another area in which they would be able to extract the gold.
At first sight, the site seems to be filled with strong men and viruses, but if we look closer, the marathon we see is working at less lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries and disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this muscle ends up like this victim of tuberculosis and the marketing of market in a few years.
This is Manhattan. When he died his father his uncle he took him to work with him in the mines.
When he died his uncle, he managed to inherit the debt of the uncle that forces him to be slave in the mines.
When I met him, I had worked in mines 14 years and the lesion of the leg that you see here is a product in the mine, so severe that doctors said it should be amazed.
In addition to that, Manhattan has tuberculosis, and it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dream with being liberated and educated with local activists like "Free The Salats: And this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility -- which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted them to know that we will take testimony of them and we'll do everything possible to help change their lives.
I honestly believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not reviewers. They are real, real people, like you, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I happen to think about these so many beautiful, male people, I've had the great honor to meet.
So I hope these images wake up a force in who you see them, in people like you, and I hope that that force is turning a fire and that that fire runs light on the slavery because, without that light, the beasts of slavery can continue to live in shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do the math that is applied and there's a peculiar problem for who makes it -- we are like management consultants.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try to tell you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
They define us the virtues of the ballet and the classic dancers -- that we'll see more ahead.
But the ballet demands a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill and probably certain initial attitude that can be a genetic component.
Sadly, neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's Parkinson's disease, gradually destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend Jane Stormont who, in his time, was a balance of ballet balloon.
So in the last few years it's been progress in the last few years.
However, there are six million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an incurable weakness, temperatures, rich and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in a objective way, and in definition, the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective and a certain medical.
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other movements of the movement there are no biological markers -- so they don't serve blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a neurological exam of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of the clinical trials, they never do. It's never been done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a difficult trip to clinic. What if patients could do the exam themselves?
You wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in neurological clinic.
So what I want to propose to you as a way of trying to try it, you see, in some sense at least at least, we're all virtual as my friend Jane Strange.
This is a video of the vocal string vibrations.
It shows somebody who's healthy as they make sound to speak -- we can imagine them as dancers of a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sound and we all have the necessary genes -- the Momble, for example.
And as the ballet requires a level of extraordinary training.
Let's think about time that takes a child to learn how to speak.
From sound, we can trace the position of vocal strings as they vibrate -- and as well as Parkinson's affected extremists, it also affects vocal organs.
So on the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of irritation terrorist of the vocal ropes.
We see the same symptoms.
The temperature and debate and recycling and right.
The speech becomes more quiet and sustained after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do you compare these tests, based on the voice with the specialized clinical trials -- well, both are non-violent.
The neurological test is not invasive -- both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do that.
Both of them are precisely. Well, but in addition to the based on voice that are not specialized.
I mean, they can be an administration.
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They are minimum cost, and we all know what happens.
Something takes a cost so low, it appears to mass scale.
These are some amazing goals.
We can reduce the logistical difficulties of patients.
It wouldn't have to go to the clinic for the routine chair.
With high frequency monitor, we could get objective data.
We could do low-cost mass record for clinical trials, and for the first time, factors on the general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first biomes of the disease before it's too late.
So when you go today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Voltcark Vanceless Initiative.
Together to Aquara and Pakistan, we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have accessible local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
anyone, with or without Parkinson's -- can call low price and leave recordings by a center, and I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So Mom, taking all these samples of, say 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What do you get out of these samples?
Max Liter: Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease. TR: Sure.
DL: You see, some people may not pass it. You may not end it up.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data collected in different circumstances and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for clean factors to look for the actual markers of disease.
TR: Do you have 86 percent accuracy right now.
MR: Much more than that.
In fact, my student Thailands, I have to publish it, has done a fantastic job, and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, which is the project. We now have 99 percent accuracy now.
TR: No nine and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
MM: Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max Liter, public.
MR: Thank you, Tom.
Before March 2011, I did photographic reports in New York City.
We are film creatures, gray creatures.
We hide in the dark, in rooms without windows and usually we avoid sunlight.
We do the even more thin developed models, the perfect perfect skin -- we do the impossible -- possible and criticize us in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the tragic events that happen in Japan.
A little time later, an organization where I was a volunteer where Hans Volvians, he was in the place working as part of the answer team.
So with hundreds of other volunteers, we knew that we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13, I traveled to Obama.
It's a small fishing village located in the Rearee of Iraq of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the waves.
The water level has reached over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers in the inside.
As you can imagine, the village was devastated.
We took the rubble from the channels and the cards.
We clean schools. We took the lights and we left the houses ready to be renewables and refrigerators.
We took tons and dead fishing tons and presentation of the local factory.
We were separated and loved it.
For weeks, both the volunteers and the neighbors found similar things.
They found photos and pictures of photos and cameras and cards and TD.
Everybody did the same.
Recognizing them and bringing them to different places of the villages around them to save them.
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that those people had suffered.
As they were fleeing out of the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in an assessment center in the town.
It helped clean the community bathrooms the huge ones, giant batteries.
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the power center picks up the photos.
They took them out and I had the honor that that day would trust me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring -- I had heard the expression to think beyond the horizon, but it wasn't until I had a straight myself that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some that had over a hundred years a few of them were still on the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that trait and repair that trait and know hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contact with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started retrigling the photos.
This was the first of all.
I was not too strangely, but where the water had decreased the face of the girl should be managed with a lot of accuracy and delicious.
Otherwise, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the strategic picture.
Over time of time, they came up with a lot more photos and they needed more reporters to go in Facebook and LinkedIn, and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries were offered to help.
In the course of two weeks, I had 150 people who were willing to join us.
In Japan, in July, we moved to Robert, a neighboring village in North York.
Once a week we used our scanner in the library photography libraries that had been installed, where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time they were going to be able to train them is a different story, depending on the waste of photos.
I could print an hour. I could explain weeks.
I could explain months.
This mile had to draw virtually by hand using the areas whose color and detail the water was not destroyed.
I took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all these pictures underwater in salt water, covered by bacteria, with algae -- even with oil, all of them along with the time of time to destroy them, so that you can wipe them by hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't pick up the picture unless I was clean, dry and had been recruited by his owner.
We were lucky with the clean by hand.
We have the guide of an amazing neighborhood.
It's very easy to hurt the photos even more.
As Window said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky in relation to photos.
He had started to wipe them herself but she stopped realizing that she would hurt them even more.
I had devastations.
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face wouldn't have been able to reconstruct the images in a single picture and retreat the whole picture.
When he picked up his photos sharing something about her story with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble quite far away from where their house used to be, but their colleagues recognized it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the correlate of closing the barriers into the waves.
He had to go inside the water as the surgeons sounded out.
His small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took him a week to find all his family and know that they all had survived.
The day he gave her most photos her youngest son 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could do -- something that he could remember to look at, something that could remember from the past that had not been marked by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had been joined by there were hundreds of them helped us clean over 135,000 photographs -- the vast majority of them, -- the great majority of them came back to hands of their owners.
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us go back to 90 families of totally respected and retrofitted photos.
During this time, we really don't spend over 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink for printer.
We take pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a place, a relationship, somebody wanted to want.
These are gungs of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take -- but the first thing we would go back to look for.
This was about this project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to somebody who was their connection with the past.
When a picture like this gets back to somebody, it makes a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of reports.
Some of them connected to something bigger -- to get something bigger, using their talent for something that are not delivered from perfect skin.
In order to finish I would like to read this email. I sent it Cin-tingle the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I was retreating, I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories shown in pictures.
One in particular, a picture with women in different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, reviewed around a baby, I moved on, because a similar picture of my family grandmother, my mother, I and my daughter newborn born, hangs from our wall.
In the entire world, in all the times our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
Doug Edison inspired us amazing and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that takes a apple in an exhibition of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion or a billion frames per second.
I introduce you a new kind of photography, the metaphorical -- a new technique that can create videos in slow cameras of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after the ringing, beyond the vision line, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and it really challenges the idea of camera.
If I take a laser pointer and turn it down in a second billion or be, in various degrees to create a picture of pictures of just a millimeter of an width of an width of a millimeter.
And that paper of photons and that bullet will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common ball.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and shoot in this bottle, how are those photons disappear inside this bottle.
What is the aspect of light in slow cameras.
Now, all of this.   Remember all of this is going to happen in less than a nonprofit is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Now, Coca-Cola did not take this research --  They happen to be a lot of things in this movie, develop this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our bullet goes into the bottle, with a package of photons that starts to admit it, and that inside, it starts to drive.
Part of the light is forced, it goes to the table, and we started seeing these incompletions.
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounces inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the reflective part of the top of the bottle of the bottle, you see the bottom of the bottle, after several squares, that the reflective reflections.
Now, if you take a common balance and you run the same distance and you see it in slow camera at about 10 billion times, how much do you think it would take us to sit down to see that film?
A day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film -- from a balance of moving.
And what about testing with dead nature?
You can see the waves that come from the table, the tomato and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, he thought, a metaphor at a time, but of course, our eyes see an integral composition.
But if you look at this tomato again, you realize that as the light comes out of the tomato -- it's still brilliant. It doesn't get dark.
Why? Because the tomato is mature and robot light inside and comes back after several billion seconds.
In the future, when this drug is in its phone, they will be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is mature without having to touch it.
What do we create this camera at MIT.
As a photographer, you know, if we take a low picture, it enters very little light.
But let's go a billion times faster than the shortest exposure, so I just got some light.
We sent that bullet -- that pattern of photons millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very astronomer synthetic, we took those giant data, and we trained them complexity to create those metaphors that I showed you.
We can take all those data in raw and process them in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a surface was allowed to see after the rings?
The idea is that we could throw some light over the door, Robert and go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
We could extract those multiple light robots.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our metaphor.
Behind the wall is a manipulation and we would bounce the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature Communists.
And a small fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works like that, our phenomenon, our phone, has unique.
It has very good temporary resolution, and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also even hidden objects, but we don't know what distance.
When you project a laser laser you can record a picture of brain, that you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, and we will take a lot of images like this, and we will bring them together and try to analyze the multiple robots of light, and with that, can we see the hidden object of the occupation?
Can we see it in 3D.
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collides with what's going on the curve of the curve.
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by the open window.
Or we could build entrepreneurs that are capable of seeing the inside of the body by adding hospitals, and the same for cartoonists.
But of course, because of tissue and blood this is quite difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about metaphorical as a new model of visualization to solve the problems of imagination in the next generation.
Just as Dr. Edison, he himself was a scientist, he turned science in art, an art of radical photographs.
I realized that all the giants of data that we collected every time they are not just for scientific visualization, but we can.
Create a new form of computational photography with slow camera and color code.
And we look at those waves -- remember, time between each of those waves is just a few billion seconds.
But here also is something fun.
If we look at the waves underneath the map, they get away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects.
The order that events happen in the world sometimes appears to the camera.
applying the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this distortion of time.
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.

With a mobile cell you can take a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile cell you can record a song, put it to Sound and make it famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a 1984 kid and I live in the city of Berlin.
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were looking for a change.
This is the 1980s. Imagine if all these people gathered to protest for a change, they had a mobile phone in the pocket.
Who are there a cell phone here?
Get them up.
Raise your mobile phone, forget it.
Forget them. An Andrew, a Blackboard, women.
It's a lot. Almost everyone today has a mobile phone.
But today I'm talking about my cell phone, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 350 lines of information.
Data in broken.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a direction.
The Data.
This director says that every European company, every single Internet of the entire Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who is called who, who sends a email to who he sends to.
Who sends him a text to who he was sending to.
And if we use mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and until two years, in his phone company or his Internet providers.
And all around Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data feedback.
We want the adult in the digital age, and we don't want the phone to and the Internet providers store all this information on us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who went out to the streets of Berlin and said, "Life, don't fear.
And some even said that this would be the Stage II.
The State was the secret police of Eastern Germany.
And I also wondered whether this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Any time I use the phone?
So I asked my phone Dele Telescope, who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, who please would send me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I got them to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all blah, white.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are protecting my life.
So I decided to tell you a judicial demand because I wanted to have this information.
But Deschange Telescope said, no, we won't give you this information.
In the end, we signed up.
I would remove the demand and they sent me the information that I had.
Meanwhile, the German constitutional German failed the unique for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly ugly ugly with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand acres of information lines.
At first I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file. Okay.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit scanner: What should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to come out.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what data feedback means.
So with Ze Oliver and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a six months visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and get away and go back and forward.
You can see every step I go.
And you can see it from Frank in train to Colon, and how often I call in the trajectory.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talk a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then one call the other, and the other one another, and we end up with this great network of communication.
You can see how your people communicate with each other to what time you call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who you send an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin in the 1980s, they had a mobile phone in the pocket.
And the State had known who participated in this protest, and if the State had known who was the leaders, this would never have happened.
The Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And I don't know about each of the Horrer Court.
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store as much information of us as possible inside and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to store them forever.
But automation and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for automatic.
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to their friends that privacy is a 21st century value and it's not going on.
When you go home, tell them that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, which information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile mobile phones to remember that you have to fight for the adult in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello TEDGlobal, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDGlobal, what happens?
My name is Mashamidia Zagan, and I'm not drunk, but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I cut my mom six times in six different directions, approved the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have brain paralysis, that's why I think it all the time.
Look at it.
It's a puzzle. I'm like a Machine mix.
and Muhammad Al.
The P, C is not genetics.
It's not confident or it can be controlled.
No one married the uterus of my mother and not the contract because my parents were cousins, even though they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened to me.
Now, I warn you, I'm not a source of inspiration, and I don't want any of the present.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they've wanted to be disabled.
Let's go from step.
Christmas values, are in the commercial center, drive in circles for parking parking and what do you see?
16 empty empty places.
And you think, "God, can I be at least a little bit disabled?
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and Dr. C, it's just one of them.
There was a flood of the operation, I would win the gold medal.
I'm a palm, Muslim, woman, disability and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park Club, in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same initials.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I could.
A lot of people with brain paralysis don't walk, but my parents don't believe in the "No se that you can."
The mantra of my father was, "You can do it -- "Charity sand."
If my three older sisters cleaned up, I cleaned up.
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents were wandering to school system, and they made sure that I was also going to be, and if we didn't get all the noticed note all of us received my mother's shoes.
My father taught me to walk at five years putting my pants on their feet and just walking.
Another technique that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I would pursue it.
The surprise that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yes. The first day in the kindergarten garden was walking like a box champion that has received a lot of burned.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're still all the family.  I think no one realized that we weren't Italian.
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use "Authoritarian to Muslims as a campaign.
The people I grew up with didn't have trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to worry about it a lot that died of hunger during the range.
I told them that I had enough fat to live three different months without eating -- so I'm going to get rid of the dawn.
Baby tape in Broadway.
Yeah, in Broadway, it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with taxis, or that I can walk with touch.
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be a kid, so if my friends used touch, I too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I didn't go.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents feared that if we didn't go back to Palestine all the summer, we become Manhattan.
In summer vacation often my father was trying to save me, so I drink hip milk -- they put me hot cups on the back, and I remember that the water burned my eyes and I thought, "It's working, work."
But the miracle cure was the game.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I do yoga I was a sympathy comment that I couldn't stand on a foot sand.
And I can now hold it in my head.
My parents reinforced this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the General Hospital Telescope.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship for the E.U., University of the state of Arizona.
It was like the male department of theater department.
They all loved me.
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the maximum note in my classes and also in his classes.
Every time I did a scene from my teachers to cry my teachers.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the United States decided to make a work called Baltimi very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with brain parallels.
I was a young girl.
So I started screaming the four windows, "In the end, I'll have a paper."
I have brain parallels."
At the end of the fine." At the end of the free."
Thank God the typefaces, at the end I'm free."
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to Mr. Brown.
I went to go through the director of the theater department, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, and asking me why and she told me that they thought I couldn't do the risk scenes.
And I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the risk stunts either, you can't do the character.
It was a role that he literally was born and gave to an actor without brain paralysis.
The university was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a strange story of hearing actors without disability for disastrous paper.
When I graduated home, I came home, and my first actor was a television on a telescope.
My dream became true.
And I knew that it would be a company responsible to better crazy friend in a sanitary.
Instead, I stayed there like a vase -- I didn't see me more than the nuclear, and it was obvious to me that reporter directors didn't hire driver actives, not white, with disability.
They just hired perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching Wolfram Gold, Rose Barry, Gold, and all these women had one thing in common: they were commentary.
So I made it humor.
In my first tour I took New York City chimpanzees from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the first comic of the first comic that I took when I fell in the course that I was going at high Jersey in New Jersey with a driver that had brain paralysis.
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East without censor and wind.
Some people say that I'm the first monitoring of the Arab world.
I never like collecting the first place, but I know that you never heard that little disgusting rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean Obama, and I launched the Feynman Command Festival in New York City, now in his 10, year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the rediscomity in the media, and at the same time remind the report principals that substantially and Arabs are not synonymous yet.
Interesting Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of the ecosystem of the disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was as invited to cable news and Kenya Albert with Keith Allen.
I went in as if it went to a graduate dance -- they dragged me to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, "Excuse me, can you give me another chair?
She looked at me and said, "Oh, four, three, three, two.
And we were living."
So I was clinging to the pressure of the presentation to not get out of the screen during the security, and when I finished the interview, I was filled.
At the end I had my opportunity and I discovered. I knew they wouldn't be invited to me.
But not only Mr. Global came back to me, but it was sort of placed in full time and pasted my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith American was that people on the Internet are school.
It's said that kids are cruel -- but they never were brought out of me and no older ones.
All of a sudden, my Internet disability became a burglar object.
I saw clips online, like, "Why short?
Is it retreat?
And my favorite, "Poor bubble terrorist.
What disease does it have?
We should really pray for it."
A suggested commentary even adding my disability to my currently: guilty, commitment, parallel.
Discovery is as visual as race.
If someone in wheelchair can't do Berkeley, then Berk can't make someone in a wheelchair.
The disasters are the -- yeah, clap man. Come on.
The disability are the largest minority in the world, and the most survival in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said I wouldn't walk, but I'm here in front of you.
However, I've grown up with media, I don't think it was.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would make less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we need all the society to teach our children.
My journey travels has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to walk through the red carpet flowing by the dividence of the Susan Luca Luca and the closed Lord Arab closed.
I got to act in a film with Adam Sandy and work with my pain, the incredible Dave Matters.
Recording the world are getting crazy."
I was deserved in the resident of the great state of New Jersey in the 2008.
And I founded "The Massachusetts of Massage: a beneficial organization to give the Palestinian refugee children a claim of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me live alive, and I dedicated this talk to his memory.
"The peace in peace, Dad painted."
My name is Mashami Zagan, and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a little boy of a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
It lives in a small town in South Somalia.
This village is near Mozart.
The drought drives the small village to poverty and the edge of innovation.
No for him there, goes to the great city, in this case, Mozart, the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there is no opportunity, no work, no future perspective.
He ended up living in a tent in the city out of Mozart.
After maybe a transportation year, nothing.
A day is about a gentleman that offered him to bring it to lunch and then dinner, to sleep.
It knows a dynamic group of people, which gives him a disaster.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home, to your family.
They present to a young man.
Finally, they're home.
It starts a new life.
It's got a life goal.
A beautiful day in McKedul, under a blue sky, put a car bomb.
That little boy of that little village with dreams of the great care was the suicide terrorist, and that dynamic group of people went to the Sambala, a terrorist organization connected to the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little kid trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him increased?
He was waiting for.
He was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for future perspective, and this was the first thing he was.
This was the first thing I pulled it out of what we call "the "I waste."
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the history of the marginals, young urban young urban youth who are disappeared in Johnson disconnected riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the waiting period.
For the young people, the great dream of the city, the great dream of the city, of jobs, of well-being, but the young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities -- the history of expert "spontaneous: the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to the panels, will be the history of the cities two.
And in my hometown, Magazine, 70 percent of the young people are unemployed.
70 percent doesn't work, it doesn't go to school.
They don't do practically anything.
I went back to Mozart last month, and I went to visit the Madison hospital, the hospital where I was born.
I remember being before that high-resolution hospital thinking, "What if I'd never been happen?
What if I had seen myself forced to be in that same period of hope?
Would I have become terrorist?
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in Mozart that month was actually to fit a few juvenile leaders in a business community.
It's about 90 Somali juvenile leaders.
We sat down, and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was Adam.
He was at the University of Mozart -- he graduated it.
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me that, because it was a graduate university, unemployed, frustrated, was the perfect white for al Shanghai and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited to be recorded.
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In Mozart, the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B are the streets.
Twenty-four years of civil war have completely destroyed the visual system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to mobilize it.
And you see an opportunity and I appreciated it.
It started a motorcycle company.
It started using motorcycles to local residents who normally couldn't buy them.
I bought 10 motors, with the help of his family and friends, and their dream is at some point to expand hundreds of engines over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What makes this story different?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the business spirit, and I think business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the waiting period.
It failed to young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking at so desperately desperate.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings Muhammad Mozart, a flower.
I was helping to train some of the young people in the summit of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative.
In fact, it's the first flower that Mozart has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mozam came in, if you wanted flowers to your wedding.
If you asked someone, "When was the last time you saw fresh flowers from friendship?
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be "Never."
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a farmer company and a floral design.
He created a farm on the outskirts of Mozarte, and she started growing to the touch and liberals, which he said, could survive the hard weather of Mozart.
And he started the delivery of flowers for was, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies, and now he's working on the creation of the first public park in Moughan in 22 years.
There are no public parks in Mozart.
He wants to create a space where families -- young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the proverbial rose.
By the way, he doesn't grow pink beats because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Muhammad had a really profound impact in the young.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for a NGOs, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact about them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
They encouraged them to believe that they could be companies, that they could be artifacts of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They identified business solutions for local problems.
So inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance to guide them in development and put in their business.
They connect young people with the resources that they need, give them the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create catalyst for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is something else to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think he's selling hope.
Her Peace Park, this is how he calls it, when he is created, transforming the way people see their city.
They advance kids on the street to help rent and keep the motors for him.
I gave them a chance to escape the paradigm of the period of hope."
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is, they make young people in business, they include and feed their inherent innovation, and they will have more stories on flowers and parks of Peace than an embryon and "sponsore paradigm."
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to lunch with my dad in the Administration mountains, an aggressive area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest forest.
The sun would make the leaves glow like a vital, and not the way we go, we can almost pretend that we were the first human beings to weigh that land.
We get to our camp.
It was a constraint in a risk with a beautiful crystal lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the contractor, there was a baseball of about four square meters with block of aluminum populations of aluminum paper and old capture.
And it was unsured, I was very angry, and incredibly confused.
The campaigns that were too lazy to pull out what they had done, who thought he was going to clean their base?
That question kept with me, and it was a little bit simple.
Who clean our base?
No matter how you organize or where you put out of it, who cleans our trash in Istanbul, who cleans in Starf?
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris, or in London.
Here in New York, the Department of Health clean our base, for about 11,000 tons of waste and 2,000 tons of recycled products every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and bring that load to it?
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his trajectories and interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still an introduction.
I needed to get more going on.
So I started working as a garbage record.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I drive.
And I operated the mechanical beetles and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as predictable as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong you get used quickly.
It costs a lot of them to the weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies continue to adjust the weight on their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the lab of Laboratory Statistics, the collection of waste is one of the 10 most dangerous occupation in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering traffic all day and pass up around you.
They just want to pass up, so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the worker.
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck.
I also learned about the impact of garbage.
When you get out of the bucket and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
Never stop coming from.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It always must be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that waste records are the most important workforce on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first public health protection.
If you don't get rid of the waste of efficiently and effective every day, this starts to desperate your container and your inherent dangers are threatened in very real ways.
diseases that we had controlled for decades and centuries come back and they start to draw.
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for the new thing that the motor engines start to fail when it's in danger the consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just sign your relationship.
And then there's what I call our average daily speed necessary.
I mean just the speed that we used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't worry about it, and we don't repair or clean or take our cup of coffee, our band bag -- our water bottle.
We use them, we throw them, we forget about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side that will come out of it.
So today I want to suggest you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce stigma and include them in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost little literature.
They're on the street every day, in a rhythmic form.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when you're waiting to wait.
And their work allows us to do our work.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us apart from ourselves, from our own waste, our disasters, and that flow has always got to stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11th, 2001, I heard the gravity of a waste collection truck on the street, grabbed my little son and went down the stairs running up, and there was a man doing his journey recycling of paper as it did all the mirrors.
And I tried to thank her for doing her work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and she just said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be good."
Shortly after that, I started researching the waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called Pauli, we worked together many times and made good friends.
I want to believe that Paul was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to reconcile the way we exist on this planet as a species we need to include and take into account all costs, even the very real human cost of the labor hand.
The municipal waste, what we think when we talk about garbage -- represent three percent of the number of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable statistics.
So in the flow of their days and his lives, the next one that you see someone whose work is to clean the garbage of you, just a moment to acknowledge them.
Take a moment to tell you very much.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally born from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Abed.
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get out of the running."
And after seeing some of these buildings there are many of these buildings in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to restore.
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the crystals with crystals generates heat inside the interior, so it takes a lot of cooling in.
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And third of all, what it looks like has nothing to do with Africa not with Ethiopia.
It's a shame of being so rich in culture and tradition.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really carried with the ancient market that is this outdoor structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little soldiers.
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design -- not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, from several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented by inspired the site, which is located in an area of much growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings we see in the image, don't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was we created a connection between these two streets, using all the inputs of the building.
And this is spread with a including attract that creates an outdoor space in the building that is self-assembly, in its own form, of the sun and the rain rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the shape of space.
I also thought, how do you close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that responds to local climate conditions.
And I set out to think about a tissue of an ant capital with perfections to allow the air input and also of light, but in a failed way.
We then inspired ourselves in these beautiful buttons of the strangers of the stage.
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the failure.
We're building that with these little predators that are the windows that let the air and the light in a way controlled to the inside of the building.
This is completely with these little crystals of colors that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It wasn't what we asked."
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the commercial center, because at the end of it there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have acceptable air.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve energy literacy for the building in a city where electricity is almost cut every day.
So we got a big advantage putting photographers on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and branches that would create this urban oasis.
And these parts on the roof, that in conjunction they collect water for the health sanitations.
It was expected for next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a teacher of 2,000 apartments and services in Tunisia.
And to do such a big project, the biggest that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention in the middle, a thousand years of anti-correspondent anti-communication that was surrounded by a wall with twelve care doors connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was extend the existing streets, creating 12 similar blocks similar in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these courtyards of Europe.
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of the doors interconnected with straight lines, and this modified the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little project of the project, like apartment, as a essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the Mediterranean climate?
And it's southern, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we set up a scheme that claims that most apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with patterns, and then on the low plant, we have all the connections for pedestrians in the floor.
And it also responds to local norms that make a greater density on higher levels and a lower density on the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like retrieving the community of the space occupied by construction.
It's where all neighbors, they can go up and socially, and make activities like running a two kilometers in the morning, or jumping from one building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives change the local communities and the local economies in the same pace that the buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking at simple but affordable solutions, which improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of hair very bright and a little pilot of penishes, link. It was super strong for state capitals -- very good for orbital.
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I brought my seat plant.
One day I left a time after the school came out of school, I was a little late and I hid myself on the bathroom of girls.
When the cost was shocked, I went out in the classroom, I took the table of my teacher the rating book.
And then I did.
I altered the ratings of my rival just a little bit, just a few like this.
Everybody like this.  And I was willing to give the book to the box. But I see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes too.
So in a sentence, he ran the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put it to all of you and myself a row of that, just for being there, I could.
I still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came up.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
And I felt important.
I don't understand why I never caught me.
It was all desperately obvious.
They never found me.
But most of all, I will tell you the reason why I was bothered that this girl, so small, was so good for oxygen.
I get into the cells.
They're so mysterious and so painting.
We know that babies suffer from cells.
Also, the primate birds are very probability.
We know that the cells are the number one cause of contractor murder in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that analyzes loneliness or long duration or sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the laboratory that the cells are studying in all their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy, I have had no literature.
Because there would be no Helen the ice, there would be no Audience."
There would be no king cell, not the thousands and a night.
There would be no Shakespeare.
They were going to have a high school reading list because we would be losing the Rude and the Furate" -- there wouldn't be "The Gates or Fairi. We would lose Machel Borde."
Without cells, there is no Project. I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers for everything, and, in terms of the jealousy, almost it has them.
This year is a 100 years of his work teacher, "In search of lost time -- the most exciting study of sexual cells, and also the most exhibition of ordinary competition, I mine, all we might have --  And thinking of Proust -- we have the mental details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a marketing marketing on you with washing up.
We forget about how hard that image.
We forget about how unlikely it is.
I mean, this is the books that Virginia Wolfram said were as hard as a cat traffic.
I don't know what the cat transport is, but we assume it's surface.
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the jealousy, the cells and Project.
Is it going to be very obvious like the cells, which are reduced to the person, to their wish, to their impersence, are a good narrative base?
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel cells.
When we feel cells, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel bad.
Being storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details to include -- to grow the knife -- right?
The cells make us all novel novels, and that's something I proved understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure to the other, maybe right now."
And it starts to tell himself that story, and since then, Proust says that every cool term that Shener's detected in his lover, he adds him to his collection of torture instruments in his private camera.
We have to admit that Shen and Proust were notoriously cleaned.
You know, Proust novels would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so nice to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
The cells are angry.
It's a hungry emotion. You have to feed it.
And how are the cells?
The cells fall out of information.
The cells use the details.
The cells like the large amounts of bright hair and the cute and little school school.
The cells fall out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  Proud linear good language with the cells of the cells.
When Shen is in his rut, he suddenly hears behind the doors and synthesis to the serving of his lover and then defending those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is reproductive, but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a monument."
He says, "It's scientific research with real intellectual value.
Project is trying to prove that the cells are international and they make us look absurd, but in their molecule, they are looking for knowledge, the pursuit of the truth, a painful truth. In fact, what Proust will be aware of, the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the humiliation, the loss, these were the pathways to the wisdom of Project.
He says, "A woman who we need, that makes us suffer in us, it causes us to make a sense of feelings more profound and vital than a wise man who was able to interplay."
Is it telling us that we are going to look for cruel women?
No. I think it's trying to say that the cells reveal us to ourselves.
And is there any other emotion that makes us open up in this particular way?
Is there any emotion reveals our agriculture, our horrible ambition and our rights?
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at so peculiar intensity?
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very awkward young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife was hooked.
And Freud says that there was something strange in that man, who didn't look at what his wife did.
Because she was innocent -- everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things he did his wife, not realizing involved, international behaviors.
smile too much, or do you accidentally do with a man?
Freud says that the man was becoming the constant of his wife's incentive.
Novels are very good at this.
novels describe very well how the cells make us look at intensity but no accuracy.
In fact, the more intense we are, the more we become the residents of the fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the cells lead us to make violent or illegal actions.
The cells drive us to behave in totally unimaginable ways.
Now I'm thinking about me about eight years old, I recognize it. But I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman in Michael of a 52 years old was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from which he was sending flying messages -- horrible to himself, for a year.
For a year. A year.
She was trying to instill the new girlfriend of his nice bond. I have to trust that when or this, I reacted to admiration when or so.
Because, let's be realistic.
How big, although unfortunately, creativity. Right?
It's like novel.
It's a novel of Patrick Higheria.
Hisporia is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the "Trouble of "The Extra in a Tree and "The Trace Mr. Richard: books that are trying to how the celestial cells, and they trust our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the cells, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be perceived in an instant.
Take Tom Richard, his most famous character.
Tom Ridge is going to be cool or want what you have to take away from your own being, and you get away from what you ever had, and it's under the floor -- responding to your name, takes your rings, cow your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom Riffile.
I can't give you everyone in the world, as much as I sometimes want.
It's a limit, because we live in time of envy.
We live in terms of cells.
That is, we are good citizens, where the currency is the soldiers -- right?
Novels show us? I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to 2214 from Baker Street and we asked by Shaker Hollands.
When people think about Hollywoods, they think of the marriage in the Morrain Professor -- that criminal genius.
But I always prefer to the "Internet Reading Charter, the head face of Stanford Arabic who needs Hollywoods desperately needs the Goldment genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, I'm so familiar so familiar.
Lester needs its help, but the residents, and bubble with a love on the fall of each of the mysteries of the mystery.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The Avenue of the Six Jeprisonians once YouTube comes in, it will take all of us with his solution, Lesterland comes back to Hollands and says, "We are not jealous -- Mr. Hollywood.
We're proud of you."
And he tells him there is no person in Scott Arabia who didn't want to shake my hand.
It's one of the few times you see Hollywoods transported in history. It seems to me this very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat the cells as a geometry problem, no emotion.
You know, in a Hollywood minute, it's on the opposite side of Lesterland.
The next minute is the same side.
Suddenly, Lesterland allows you to admire that idea of being the research.
Could it still be so simple.
What if the cells are really an issue of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be relative to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to remind ourselves from the excellence of the other.
We can align with it.
But I like continuation plans.
So as we wait for that to happen, we remember that we have the fiction.
Only the fiction described the cells.
First of all, the doctors are invited to the table.
And look at what I force: The Duttie Leonardo, the atheist Tom Richard, the Shark March Muslim.
We are at excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the Apollo 11 Moon and he turned on the Sea of the Charistation.
Armstrong and Albrine were alone alone, but their presence in the surface of the moon surface was the culmination of a conventional collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest mobility in peace times in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave work at about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including Apollo 1.
But before the Apple program finally, 24 men traveled to the moon.
He was walking on their surface, which Alexander after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the oldest old.
So why were they?
They didn't take a lot of become, 38 pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 percent of the time, a new sense of small and fragility of our common home.
Why were they? The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the Soviets that this nation had better rocket.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rica in 1962.
John F. Kennedy Some questions, why is the Moon?
Why to turn it into our goals?
And you might also ask, why do you scale the mountain higher."
35 years ago, why would we fly over the Atlantic.
Why do you play Rice against Texas.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason Poverna," for contemporary, the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the East War.
At the time, the strongest emotion was the most strong emotion to the transparency of the power of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing in the Moon happened in a context of a long list of technological translators.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and plane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the pollinatory is eradicated and removed the smallpox.
Technology seemed to have what Alvin Thomast in 1970 called acceleration force."
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a sailing ship -- but in 1969, the Apollo 10 flew at 40,000 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human being has come to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than Apollo 10, and the optimistic joy about the power of technology has been evolved by seeing that the technology will solve like going to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seem to have been intrigued.
I remember seeing the Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that you don't look at the climbing tube called the Saturn V rocket.
I really knew that this would be the last moon, but I was completely sure that I would come to see the colonies on Mars.
So that from something happened to our ability to solve problems with technology has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologies had been distracted and enriched with trivial toys, things like iPhone, applications and social networks, or algorithms that accelerate the automated window.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a partial explanation in Silicon Valley, who confirmed that they have created less ambitious companies than the years in which Intel was funded in, Microsoft, Apple and Genetically.
Silicon Valley says that markets are the bulls, in particular, the incentives that risk capitalists offer to business.
Silicon Valley says that risk investment caused the creation of traditional ideas by the funding of incremental problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It explains mostly what's wrong in Silicon Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their local point without worrying about the risk, they prefer small investment, microscopic investment that they could go out in 10 years.
The CR. They've always had trouble investing with technology in technologies as energy, which need huge capital and whose development is long-term -- they've not invested in the development of technology destined to solve big problems because they don't have a immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose to not solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we wanted to.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars required a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things than doing on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and biological. Less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic.
Carbon and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind energy, and oil is cheaper than biological.
We want alternative energy sources that can compete in price. They don't exist.
Now, technologies and entrepreneurs and economists agree about what politicians and international treaties would include development of alternative energy, mostly a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we will see an energy policy of America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that look like technologies, they don't get to be.
We know for the time of the time that the famine are result of the failure in the food department.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famine are political crisis that affect food distribution.
Technology can improve things like harvest collapses or systems for storage and food reform, but there will be famines as there are bad governments.
Finally, big problems are sometimes elected by a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nike declared the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some terrible resistance to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective and viable treatments.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we should, but these four elements have to be present -- the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, and institutions have to support the solution. It must be really from technological problem, and we should understand it.
The Apollo mission -- which has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it meets those creatures.
But it's an extraordinary model in the future.
We're not in 1961.
There is no constructive competition like the Cold War, there is no policy like John Kennedy who smells how hard it is and the dangerous thing, and there's no popular science of science fiction as to explore the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even solving any problems.
We are alone in our present and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows we don't need the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Okay, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by remembering the general ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they have become clicks of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a record: there's been a great decline of trust, is a very pervasive belief.
The second is a goal, we should have more trust.
And the third is a task, we should recover trust.
I think the record, the goal and the task have been wrong.
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a record, an objective and a task, which I think gives you a clearest idea about it.
First of all, why do people think confidence has discovered?
And if I think about the basis of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
I bow up to think that it may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that might have increased each other.
I don't have it.
But I can go to the polls of opinion, and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were discovered about 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, they continue to inspire the same discovery.
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still pretty reliable -- judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen on the street is almost exactly half the way.
But is this enough evidence?
What the opinion survey polls are, of course, opinions are.
What else can you record?
What you see are the generic attitudes that people manifest when you ask some questions.
Do you trust the politicians in the teachers?
Now, if someone would ask you, "Do you rely on the vegetables?
Do you trust the fishermen?
Do you trust the primary teachers?
They'll probably start to ask, "What do you do?
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you might say, when you have answered your question, "Well, trust you, but in some other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to depend on trust in a different way.
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel for a certain kind of officer or functional or kind of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, saying I trust a certain primary teacher that I know to give the lesson class, but in any way to drive the school microbes.
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good driver.
I could trust my most crazy friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to save a secret.
Simple.
And if we've gotten those evidence in our daily lives in the way that trust is different, why do we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more abstract way?
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to absorb good judgment in the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what happens to the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
And frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
That's not the goal that I would have.
I would aim to have more confidence in what it is about trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a part of not trust in what's not trust.
And I think those people who depressed their savings with the very clearly named Mr. Madow, who then disappeared with them, and I think, well, yes, they were too confused.
Having more confidence is not an intelligent target in this life.
Confidence or denied intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say it, it says, yes, OK, that means that what matters first is not the trust, but the trustworthiness.
What's about making a judgment about how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think in order to make a trial, we are forced to focus on three things.
Are they competition? Are they honest? Are they responsibilities?
And if we find that one person is competitive in the perfect materials, and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, by contrast, they're not responsible -- we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but I don't trust them to bring a letter to the email because they're forgettan.
I have friends who are very sure that they can make certain things, but I see that I see their own competition.
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are competent and responsible but extremely desperate.
If this is, I haven't been shocked.
But that's what we're looking for?
The trust is the answer.
trustworthiness.
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last decades, we've tried to build accounts of accountability systems for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that made us easier the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as they should.
I remember once I was talking to a piece and he said, "Well, you see, the problem is it takes more time to do the administrative paper than assisting the part of it."
And we found the same problem in all of our public lives, and institutional -- that the accounts of accountability that is destined to guarantee conflict and trust testing, is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is to tell the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the parts, to choose them to make the careers shape," as we say.
I sure you all know similar examples.
All that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more confidence, and that things would be different if we try to be trusted and transfer to the people who are reliable and whether we try to determine whether other people, officials or policy are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the judgment, the simple actions, the attitudes that don't do properly.
Third, the task.
To call the task rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
You suggest that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct the trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust -- in definition, it's distinctive because the other other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough foundation so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't pick up, usually all the people, all the time.
But you also have to bring up the federal evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That is done every day, everywhere, all over the place, the common people, the functions, the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I bought my socks says I can give them to them without giving explanations.
I carry them up and give me the money, or they change them by the color that I want.
That's great. Trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and trust you are saying.
So at the end, I think what we're pointing about is not a very difficult thing to discover.
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers we've been striving to reduce separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that imagination can be desperate.
This separation has been made, increasingly and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the spirit of the glass of a tactile screen, and the power of computer has become accessible to everyone.
But I wonder, and if there were no barriers.
I started imagining what it would be.
First created this tool that goes into digital space, so when the strong opposite against the screen transfers its physical body to prices.
Designers can kill their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool they break up the barriers.
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?
In the division of the Microsoft Applications of Microsoft, along with my mentor Cather Bollel, redefined the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
By combining a transparency with depth cameras to detect the fingers and the face, now you can raise the hands of the keyboard, get to the inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and the files have an location in real space, select them is as easy as adding a book from a shelf.
You can hold the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is down from every floating screen.
architects can stretch or rotate their machines directly with their hands.
In these examples, we enter the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make digital information come to us?
Sure, many of us have bought and back things online.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual project on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device in the head or transplant when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physical so that we can touch them and feel it?
What would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Island and my collaborator Reice Pastura, we created this only physical key.
This spherical magnet is behaving as a 3D phone in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
So simplicity, what we did was we announced gravity and control the movement through a combination of magnetic levitation and mechanical performance.
And when we program digitally the object, we release it from time constraints and space, which means that human movements can record and reproduce.
You can teach the physically and disappointed companies and the famous takes Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality the time we wanted to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or the textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel. It's very powerful.
But what's most fascinating about changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information will not only show us something but begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world around us that we have to tell us from our world.
We started talking today about a barrier, but if we suppress that barrier, the only limit that remains is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was trained to become a gym for two years in Huntend, China, in the '70s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer to a school for athletes with all expenses with all expenses with it.
But my tiger said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become an engineer, like them.
After survival the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believed that there was only a certified path to happiness, a safe and safe job.
No matter whether the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera sentence.
This was me, in my imagination piano.
A opera singer must start to train from very young to learning the activists, so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.
He even wrote to the school director and the president of a radio program.
But no adult was embracing the idea.
No adult took me serious.
Only my friends supported me, but they were kids, no authority like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much greater to train.
My dream would never be done.
I feared that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I solved looking at another vocal.
No one around me wanted to teach me? Okay.
It goes back to books.
"Operations Completely "Alley Charles East Charley: "Let's get to America in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
The ones who were banned in China, of course.
The Earth is the Chinese Chinese life.
And it's not convenient. I understand.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a reverse," "Harvest to your father and your mother."
"Honey, I said, "It's so different, and much better than opening."
So it became my tool to come out of this confusing circle and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave my comparative reading habit too.
It creates a lot of perspective.
For example, this map seemed to me, because this is what students in China learn it.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
Comparison reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are all the way up to research fields like comparative religion and comparative literature.
Compare and contrast, it offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it also in everyday life?
So I started reading two.
You can treat people from Walter Islamist by Walter Isability "Whoop Adams who were involved in the same subject, or friends with shared experiences.
For the crisis, the temptation is economic, politicians and spiritual.
To the Buddha, they're all psychologists: lust, fear and social owner and interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
"The path of Charley They "Trace Mercoton The Tablet Talk Alama Area instead of losing me in translation. I found that you can make a lot of it.
For example, it's through translation I realized that happiness in Chinese literally means "gigantic "a quick."
And "Nichon in Chinese, literally new mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to go back to feeling alone or powerless again.
Having a deleted dream is really not compared to what many others have suffered with.
I've come to believe that reality is not the only purpose of a dream.
Its most important purpose is to connect with the place that dreams come from, where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Even a destroyed dream can do that for you.
And it's because of books, which I'm here today happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always accompanied them.
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first psychological client of psychotherapy.
I was a Ph.D. student in Berkeley psychology.
She was a 26 year-old woman named Alex.
Alex went into the first session using jarks and a hole top, threw in the couch of my office came off the shoes and told me I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so flowing.
My classmates had a pyramid like the first client of it.
And I got a venture that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the short stories that Alex brought to the sessions, he made me easy just to move the head while we got back the solution.
The training is the new verse: he said, Alex, and so I saw, she was right.
You start working later, you get home and then you have kids later, to death later.
For veterinarians like Alex and I had time.
But shortly after, my supercomputer took me to press Alex who would talk about his love life.
I was resistant to me.
I said, "Sure, he's coming out with guys under his category, and he takes up with a head head, but it's not as if he went married with him."
And then my supercomputer said, "Not just not, but maybe it's married with the next one.
In addition, the best time to work at Alex marriage is before it comes to me."
This is what psychologists call a moment "Ah."
It was when I realized that the 30 is not the new 20th.
Yes, people feel head after what was used to, but this didn't make the 20th of Alex were a pause in their development.
This made the 20 of Alex were the perfect moment and we were wasting it.
So I realized that this kind of benign negotiation was a real problem and had real consequences -- not just for Alex and his loving life but for roads, families and future ventures everywhere.
There are 50 million veterans in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one gets to adulthood without going on before at the time.
Raise your hand if you're in your 20.
I want to see the verses here.
Oh, yeah! They're amazing.
If you work with veterinarians, you love a veteran, you take your dream a veteran -- I want to see -- OK.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will go at 35 years.
This means that eight in 10 decisions and experiences and moments -- who shape his life will have happened to be 30 and so many.
People from over 40 don't train in panic.
This audience is going to be well, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have exponential impact about how much money they win.
We know that over half of Americans are married, they live or go out with their future partner.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its 20s and reproduced for adults, which means that if there's something they want to change themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their 20 than any other time in life, and we know that female fertility gets to its top at the age of 28 and things become complicated at 35 percent.
The 20 are the time to educate about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily and common life has an impact on the person who will become a being turned on.
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our 20s are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the ventures are listening.
Personalities talk about changes in the time of adult time.
The researchers call the 20 an extended adolescence.
journalists accumulate names of ridiculous names like "Texts and "strikes?
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a translation that is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonardo Bernshan said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it?
What do you think happens when you give a venture in your head and say, "Do you have another 10 years to start your life?
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and their ambition and nothing happens absolutely nothing.
And then every day, versions like you or your children and your daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know my girlfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count, I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as you start a career before the '30s, everything will be good."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My 20s are about to end and still have nothing to show you.
I had better current day than I graduated from college.
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the age of 20 were like chairs.
They all run and get fun, but then at some point about 30, the music came up and they all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was standing stop, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I was 30."
Where are the versions here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but don't wrong, the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the 1970s, there's a huge pressure to the traffic and so many of you will start a career, pick a city, choose a mate, and have two or three children in a much smaller period of time.
Many of these things are not complexity, and there are research that start showing you, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything at the age of 30.
The police crisis crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
So realizing you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of traffickers and quarks look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and talk about their 20s, "What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the ventures are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called Emma.
At the age of 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said that he would like to work on art or entertainment but still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a message.
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, which showed more early than ambition.
And despite the very difficult 20 very difficult life had been even more difficult.
He cried often in our sessions, but then he stood up her to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got put his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
And I had just bought a new freedom for director, and he had spent every morning filled with his many contacts, but then he looked at the empty space that follows after the words -- "In the case of emergency -- please call him."
I was at the point of history when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a car accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I get cancer?
At that time, I was a lot of work to resist and not say, "Aye."
What Emma needed was not a therapy that was really worried.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot from I worked with Alex as to just sit while the decade of Emma was going on.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all veterans, man or woman, deserves to know.
First, I told Emma to forget from that identity crisis and get an identity capital.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that adds value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of Emma career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity of identity generates capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that intervention, of that company that you want to try to test.
I'm not going off the vertical exploration, I'm discovering the exploration that I shouldn't tell you, by the way, it's not exploration.
It's progression.
I told Emma to explore jobs and make them tell them.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are supporting.
The best friends are excellent to lead to the airport, but the verses that come together with friends with similar minds are limited to who you know, what you know, how they think, and where they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will go out almost always comes from outside of their closest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak friends friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the ventures have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the way to color this group.
Half of the work they created was never published, so knowing the boss of your neighbor is the way to get a job done.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
Finally, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but you know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a veteran email, Emma soon to choose his family, when he has a partner and formed her own family.
I told Emma that time to choose his family had arrived.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit than the 20 or even 25, and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live right now or take care of now when everyone in Facebook starts walking towards altar.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have it, and that means being as intentional in love as you're at work.
To choose your family must be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just making it work or kill time with whatever it is to you.
So what happened to Emma?"
Well, we went back to that principal, and she found the roommate of a cousin who was working in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That offer of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend that he lived with.
Now, five years later, it's special organized in museums.
This married with a man who chose consciously considered.
He loved his new career, he loves her new family, and she sent me a letter who said, "Now the emergency contacts are not big enough.
Emma story can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with versions.
It's very easy to help them.
The veterinarians are like airplanes that come out of Los Angeles airport, which comes out somewhere in the West.
Right before the crash, an adult slight in his trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or First.
The same way, at 21 or 25 and even 29, a good conversation, a good descent, a good TED Talk, can have huge effects in the following years or even in the following generations.
Here's my idea of spreading all the ventures that you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell Alex to Alex.
It's what I now have the privilege to tell you about versions like Emma every day, transplants are not the new 20 percent, pick up their adult, get identity capital, use their weak bond, they pick your family.
They don't stop defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in general consulting for a job that was even more exceptionally, the documentary.
I went to teach them mathematics to state students in the public schools in New York City.
And like any teacher, I applied exams.
It gives you tasks.
When the work came back, he calculated grades.
What I was called the attention was that C wasn't the only difference between my best and worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance didn't have Chinese publishers.
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in the seventh grade, safe, are difficult, proportions, democracy, the area of a parallel.
But these concepts are not impossible, and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over enough time.
After several years more document, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a motivated perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's C, but what happens if you succeed in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn in fast and easy way?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a psychology.
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of challenging stage, and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the Middle West Activity.
We tried to predict what chains remain in military training and who would be retrofit.
We went to the National Content of Delth and tried to predict what children would move the best possible in competition.
We studied novel teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods, asking us what teachers will still be teaching for the end of the school year and those who are the most effective to improve the outcomes of the learning of their students.
We partnered with private companies, wondering what of these marketers are going to keep their job point?
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, a characteristic was emerged as a major prediction of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It was not the good appearance, physical health and not the I.Q.
It was the determination.
Detection is passion and perspective to reach very long-term goals.
The determination is to have resistance.
The determination is to land into its future, day after day, not only a week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a marathon -- not a race to all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who made my determination questions and then wait about more than a year to see who they were gradually.
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater likely to graduate them, even when they made them in every characteristic that I could measure, things like family income, the results of standardized testing, even the security that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or at the National Content of Delth in which the determination is -- it's also in school, especially for children in risk of abandoning it.
For me, the most important thing about determination is how little we know, how little the science knows about development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I develop determination in children?
What should I do to teach children a solid job?
How do you keep them motivated for the long term?
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you determination.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that are simply not going ahead with their commitment.
In fact, in our data, the dominant determination is not related or even related to talent measurements.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing the determination in children is something called growth mentality."
This is a developed idea at Stanford University by Carol Departmer, and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not financial, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. Department has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and learn about the brain and how it changes in response to challenge, they're much more likely to perceive when they fail, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mindset of growth is a great idea to develop determination.
But we need more.
And that's where I end my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have ahead of it.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger institutions, and we need to test them.
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to get wrong, and start all again with the lessons learning.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our kids more determined.
Thank you.
Growing in Taiwan like the daughter of a calority, one of my most scary memories is my mother showing the beauty and the shape and the shape of Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But for an alien, it seems to be as impressive as the Great Music China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break this multiple, so that whoever I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and rapid method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every single character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academics would understand 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic alternative.
The first 200 percent will allow 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read transmission signals, meters of restaurants to understand the basic idea of the websites or the newspapers.
I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
They open their mouth as much as possible until it's square.
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
person.
If the shape of the fire is a person with arms on both sides as if they were screaming up in a framework, Australia." I'm burning -- this symbol is actually original in the form of the call, but I like to believe that it's the other way. The one that works.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The door symbol looks like a couple of doors from a song in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks so they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's to go."
As the ancient said, two are companies, three are multiple.
If one person would stretch their arms, this person is saying, "It was this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is stuck.
It's a prisoner as Joses inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
They put a table under the tree, we have the cybers.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a stuff."  Easy to remember, because a parallel tree is pretty idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two fires together, it gets very hot.
Three fire together, that's a lot of calls.
They put the fire under the two trees, that is to burn out.
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, I propose ...
Three together, those are details.
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the brilliant.
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out on the horizon. And the sun.
A door. Put a table inside the door, is the corrupt of the door.
They put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
Did you have somebody at home?
This person is coming up hidden from a door, digging up, flowing.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're discussing them.
Three women together, they have care of it is adult.
So we've gone through nearly 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical endless will allow you to build 32.
The next eight care group will build another 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters -- which is the same thing that you learn a eight years old.
So after knowing the characteristics, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a volcano.
We know that Japan is the land.
This is a sun placed with the origin because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the origin we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked on one another.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile. Because Chinese entrepreneurs destroyed their political enemies beyond mountains.
Today, the exile has become coming out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a saving.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be a dad.
I love to share my favorite films with my children, when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Okay magician together.
The film master his imagination for months.
His favorite character was Glass, of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a bright dress and bring a magic wand to it.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex of child fantasy.
However, the Okay magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took a fourth years later with it, interestingly, another movie whose prototypes, a little boy of metal and a pend kid rescued a girl dressed as a guard of enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there is a couple of big differences between the Ohoope magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the Oz Mageria.
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like apples.
But I think if the Ozz magician is done today, the magician would say, Doroth, you're the Sala salvation as the prophet predicted it.
You use magic shoes to defeat the computer-generated army computers of the barrier male.
But that's not what happens.
Another one thing about the magician of Oz is that the most heroic characters -- wise and even the values are women.
I began to notice this when I did Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a child.
It was only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the survival level had come down.  So he was devoted in the room, and he was impressed as a leg mom with his legs behind it, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but inevitably, it absorbs everything.
I wonder what it does.
Would you be about value and perfect and long-term?
Would you have the feeling that Luke, a performance to demonstrate the government?
Let's compare this with Oklahoma Mageria in 1929.
How does Dorothy win his movie?
By making good ants with all of us and being a leadership.
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow Oh, okay? And not a world of men who fight, which is where we are.
Why is there so much capital Father force, force in films for our children, and so little the way of yellow legal legs?
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence movies, and they should read it. It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stuff.
I know for experience that the Leonar princess doesn't provide the right framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults that are microbes.  I think at the moment of the first kiss --  I think the first kiss -- I really hope that the credit will start to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search has done, I have nine.
Why do they stay there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focus on defeat the link and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other adventure.
It's almost like a kid, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a war suit.
There's a lot of exceptions, and I will defend Disney princess to any of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though they, kids are not really their objective audience.
They do a phenomenal job when they teach girls how to defend the pathogen, but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the pattern.
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely like Herbie and Kats -- but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all time continues to appear at classical after classic -- each of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and son, or two men who make a child.
And as many of you are thinking, this year, finally it came out.
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when Valley came out?
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a prison.
It's very good. Don't let it stop it to you.
Well, almost none of these movies pass the Rechivopy test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not risky and it's already properly, but maybe we will start a movement.
Alisa Rechimpane is a comic drawing, and in the middle 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend about the assessment of films that they saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be done, in the movie, there's more than a female character than you have lines?
So, you have to fulfill the requirement.
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Your conversations are about something more apart from the guy than you like --  Okay?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
It happens. I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the movie we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality of a very good quality, Arizona.
Right? Rumor from Osama, a puzzle idea of what a Hollywood Hollywood film is.
Virtually it doesn't happen the Rechivopy test.
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in an ambassador where men and women hide during the recent crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this school, and it's the great moment for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "Come to bed, car?
This is Hollywood.
So you look at the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 most popular movies, how many of them think they have female protests?
It's not wrong.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women who have recently chosen for Congress, so it's fine.
But there's a bigger number that is going to spread this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
Here's what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted once in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the kids for kids have something to do with that.
I don't think music videos or pornography are closely linked -- but something wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there is a lot of sexual agriculture.
Who are those guys, what are you learning about?
What can't you learn to?
They're simulating the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the link with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not talking?
Are we feeding that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very alarming statistics and we want to prepare them.
We have tools to our discussion as we can put it, and we expect that to help, but I have to ask, but I have to ask, will you protect it is going to protect you, at the same time, active or passively -- are we educating our children to maintain their male power?
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and I mean mostly the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of shoulder.
The definition of malnutrition is radically changing.
You will have read about how the new economy is changing the role that care of home and adaptation.
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite character of "Star Warreneas know what he responded?
Well-being innovation.
Western Kenya and Glass.
What do they have in common?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories to tell my son, "Go and struggle just and more stories where it looked like his work is to join a team -- maybe a team leading by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the Ohoopevilla.
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine, and one of the things I liked the most was to look for sea cookies.
But you know, it's hard to find these shells.
They're covered by sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was used to looking for them.
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me to tell them.
This became a passion for finding things, in a love by past and architecture.
And finally when I started studying egosity, I realized that I would see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of a mile of length next to the Nino.
And my sea cookies had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew that I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use infrared infrastructure.
This is a place that was located in the eastern desert of Egypt called Benda.
And the place, in the naked view, seems to be a brown, but when we use the infrared and we process it using false color, suddenly the place looks like a brilliant rose.
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of landscape caused by building materials and the activities of ancient Egyptians and activists.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city, called Texas, lost for thousands of years.
Tetherom was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place was located in the Family, Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire -- there was this great renaissance of ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
The electricity has always known that Tetherom was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that they built them, indicated inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge relief planning.
This area is huge, about six percent per 3,000 miles.
Before, the Nick flowing right next to Texas and as he changed over time, he moved into this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a separate city in an extensive landscape?
Trying to find the random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a pandemic, with the eyes sold and using baseball gloves and weapons.
So we use NASA to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the Nike flows up.
But you can see more detailed, and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, we think it might be the location of Titan.
So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists doing sample work. You can see it here.
When I say show, it's like sample shots, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation.
Five feet below a thick layer of light, we found a dense layer of ceramics.
This means that in this possible location of Tether, five meters down, we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years that date the Middle Empire, exactly the same period we think it's Tether.
We also found stone jobs, coral, cortex and cat, which shows that there was a jewelry shop.
This might seem to be not much, but when we think about the most common stones used in the Moon Empire, these are the stones that were used.
So we have a dense layer of occupation that drives the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have an evidence of a elite jewelry workshop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We don't find Titan here, but we go back to the place in a nearby future to locate it.
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also do great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote of the Middle Empire probably written in Tibet 4,000 years ago.
Sharing knowledge is the largest of all cars.
There's nothing like that on land.
So you know, TED was not founded in 1984 Dr. C.
It made ideas really started in 1984 to C, in a city lost not for a long time and found from high school.
It certainly puts the search for marine shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of your doorstep.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that's done.
Now they visualize a bunch of obese obese subjects.
They're competing in a cloud of bicycles and they're going to direction to their input door.
I need you to see this.
They're perminated strong, they're studying -- they go through a lot.
And they collide against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying all over the place, wheels that go through their side, lightning from the wheels that end up in absurd places. They pass the threshold of the door.
To the lobby, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light, the light shining over the Molar of the Galapagos.
You're holding them with your hand.
You know, from your chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse.
You can feel your blue ball making them cost in your nose.
You can smell the banker flag and you're about to get into the mouth.
They go on the one side and train their living room.
In the room, and making maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney Spannets.
He's with a little bit of clothes, dancing on his center mess, singing "Hi Band One Morning Time."
Now look at the kitchen.
The soil has been recorded with a path of yellow brick brick and from the oven come to you Dorman, the Man of Jaoson, the Spaceship and the Leon of "Oh, the Ohoopera of the Hait, jumping out of the hands, jumping up.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a scientific journalist, waiting for, I guess, that this was like the end of a wise supercomputer.
There were several men and a few different ladies of different ages and different hygiene.
They were memorize hundreds of random numbers, looking at them only once.
They memorize the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
They memorize entire poems in just minutes.
They compete to see who I could memorize with higher rapidly the order of a narrative of nations.
And I thought, "This is incredible.
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cocomurt who had come from England and has one of the best trained memories.
I said, "Hey, when do you realize you were a sandwich?
Ed said, "I'm not a wise guy.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who's involved from this competition say they have normal memory.
We have been trained to do these miraculous memory acts using some ancient techniques, invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that Cyrus used to memorize their speeches and the medieval academics used to memorize entire books."
And my reaction was, "Okay. How did I not hear about this before?
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and Ed who is a wonderful and brilliant English, even though a little bit exceptional, he said, "John, you are an American journalist.
You know Britney Sparis?
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney Spanish how to memorize the order in a character of live nations, national television.
That would test the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney Spanish, but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start for something right?
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not only training my memory, but also researching it, trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what it can be your potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called E.
He is animation, very likely with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a memory problem, it's amazing.
Someone incredibly tragic -- but it was a window that allows us to see what our memory point makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim Pearl. He was based for the paper of Dustin Hollywood in the "Man Man."
We spent a afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City, memorizing telephone guides, was central.
And when I came back, I read a number of writers about writing memory about 2,000 years ago in Latin, and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of trained memory, discovering and culture was not just as rare as you might seem today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide faster their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed us, and I would say that they have changed us as well.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of an trained memory, discovering and culture is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so simplifying -- there's competition like this all around the world.
I was fascinated -- I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at the University College of London invited a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know: Will you have brains in some way, structural or anonymously different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of it?
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually no.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the control subjects that they shared them.
When they put them into a magnetic resonance machine, they scan their brains as they memorize numbers and faces and stores of snow, they found that in memory champions were lit up of the brain, different than others.
They actually used them, or they seemed to use, a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? Is there something we can learn from this?
The tournament of competitive memory is driven as an armed career where someone comes up with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors have to put the day.
This is my friend Ben Princetoor, three times of memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 sides of messy names that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only dominated.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 44 random binary digital.
In half an hour. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways to remember things in these competitions, absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the end of a concept that psychologists call "electrical coding."
It illustrates with a paradox known as the Balibone Canada: "Watermakers says this: I say to two people who remember the same word -- I tell you you -- "You remember a man called Baker."
That's the application.
And then I ask them, "Do you remember there's a banana panel."
And when I go back later, and I ask them, "Do you remember that word I told you about a mouse?
"Do you remember what it was?
The person who was told that his name is Balaway is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that their work is baseball."
The same word, different memory capability, that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name of Balband, it doesn't really mean anything for you.
With all the other memories that dance for their head.
But the word, "Babylon." We know panels.
They use simplicity white hats.
They have hurt in the hands.
They smell good when they come home to work.
We probably know some paraly.
And when we first heard that word for the first time, we began to put some associated anti-communications to make them very easily at some time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this data from two thousand years ago at the ancient Greece.
It's known as the memory pilot."
The story says like this: There was a poet called Simonius who attended a bank.
They had hired it as an entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, it didn't go to a Darwin, it was hired to a poet.
He stood out of the foot, he got his memory poem, and she married, and so soon he was, the bank room was collapsed down.
They're killing everybody.
But not only killed them all, but I destroyed the bodies by leaving them incredible.
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So you could not get the bodies.
One tragedy behind the other.
Similarities, standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where every single inventor had been sitting in.
He took the family of the hand by taking them where they were their loved ones between the schools.
What simulated Simonina at that moment is something that we all know more or less intuitively, and it is that no matter if we are not good for remembering names or numbers of phone or instructions for our colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional space.
If I asked you to get the first 10 words in history that I just told you about Simoninalists -- it's very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask them to say who sitting on the parallel horse in their vehicle, they would be able to visualize it.
The idea of the tobacco of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and put it from images with the things that you want to remember -- the more crazy it is, the more crazy and fantastic and scary and application that is the image, more inevitable to be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties in Latin, in land.
And how does it work?
Let's say that you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it in memory, the same way you would have done it if you had invited it if you were invited to TEDx 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that you're at the door of your house.
And to think of some kind of absolutely ridiculous image crazy and innovative to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely instinctive competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and you can see the Monterey of the Galleries mounted on Missis Ed.
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed Cockava.
And then you would see Britney Spannests to remind you that funny fantastic that you want to tell.
And then they went into the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk to be that strange journey that they did for a year ago, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how Roman speakers memorize their speeches -- not word for word, which is going to confuse it but typical per typical percent.
In fact the typical term comes from the Greek Green" -- which means play."
It's a secret of when people thought of the orbit and the rhetoric with these kind of space terms.
The phrase in the first place? It would be like the first place in his memory paleonth.
I saw that this was just fascinating and I kept full of it.
I went to some of these memory competitions, and I had the idea of writing something outside about this subjective memory bubble.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a politically boring event.
Seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting extensions. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone is massively massively.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in these people's minds, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put it in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sat down to see the New York Times -- just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem, or the names of an ancient school anger bought in a pulse market.
And I discovered that this was surprisingly entertaining.
I would never expect it to be.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is getting more and more the ability to create and imagine these ridiculous images, chimpanzees, provided, insects and inefficient iconic -- in the eye of the mind.
I was pretty happy with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a pair of ears and covered security catches with just two bees, because distribution is the worst enemy of a memory competition.
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year earlier. I had the idea that I could increase, in a kind of participatory journalistic experiment.
I thought this might serve all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the concept, something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's cute to be able to memorize speech, and phone numbers, and you know, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks.
Because they're based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be put to build memory pales or memorize characters of nations. To benefit with a little bit of perspective about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was an innate gift -- but it's not the case.
Great memories are education.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we concentrate deeply.
The memory paleonth. These memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even shortcuts.
They work because they make us work.
They force a kind of deep processing process, a kind of complete attention that most of us don't walk around by running around.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things do memories.
And if there is something that I want to leave you today is what EDI, the amazing that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence in the Blackstocks or iPhone, not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks on our side. Are we so humble that we don't even bother to process in profession?
I learned from the first hand that there are amazing memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life, you must be the kind of person who remember remembering it.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about the last 30 years of architecture history.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we would take just a complex place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from N, Jersey, I was six and I lived there at home from my parents in a village called Lindanian, and this was my child's bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom. I was the bathroom who shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balance that gave the living room.
And there they all spent the tissue watching the television -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, they all saw me -- and every time I drew me back and I went back into a towel. I all saw me.
And I was like this.
It was a torture, insecure and hated it.
I hated that record, hated that balcony. hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
Ready.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of zones, but of those visual connections, we feel in the places we occupy in the place.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little bit naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what it is -- you think about power, "statistical and democracy.
And I know that you think about based on a building building two thousand years ago for the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a disappointment that the architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's a predictable emotional connection, we've used this trick for many, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
Look, these stable, standard soldiers, solid in front of the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who build the urbanization and the governments, always are afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice building.
It's the Linux Public Library that ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a dome -- it has this round thing, columns -- red literally, red literally, red legal legitimate, which leaves to deliver what Lindani is trying to communicate with this building, the kids, the property values, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, another library is finished like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to meet, reading and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both of these buildings, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the pink.
On one side is innovation, architects who constantly drive new technologies, new technologies, new solutions for current life.
We move, we drive and push so much, we get away completely from people.
All of the black, this depressed us. You think we feel very good, but we're dead inside because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and connect them to those service symbols.
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like translates, so we started experimenting again, we make the pile back to forward, over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago we came out of the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called "Radionable."
It has to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
Small windows in democratic scale.
Something really hard.
So we got closer to the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We push the pink again in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know they like to like it, and we update them.
We add neurons and we added pastes and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give it obsession.
We took Christians armorpoints and we turned them into responses, which can be medieval chairs made of glass.
The forms were adding, they won in audacity and color.
The waves became columns in them.
The crisis grew up to the size of buildings.
There's crazy.
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spent the mouse in commercial centers, we moved to neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own architectural fantasy.
Those fantasies could be in the medicine, the French or the Italian thing.
Probably with a bread.
This is what happens to position.
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we remember memories from other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the Taskines.
This is Ohio.
The architects are frustrated and we start making the pile back in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called descriptions.
We download the historical symbols, now we have new design techniques of computer design, and we find ourselves with new compositions.
This is academic and immigrant, and it's super implant. You're totally exceptionally.
Usually the wild pink again in opposite direction.
But then, something amazing happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's Bill George from Frank George.
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul Goldier said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical, academic and public in general, were completely according to a building.
The New York Times qualified this miracle construction.
The tourism in Bilbao turned up in a 2,500 percent when the building ended up in Bilbao.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those buildings, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, September.
Everybody wanted one, and George was everywhere.
He was our first star architecture.
But how is it possible that these shapes and wild and radical and radical things, how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was gaining around them, and quickly we learned that those shapes would mean culture and torture.
We've created emotional reaction with these forms.
The same did the main mayor of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourist.
This phenomenon of beginning in the new millennium has been with other star architects.
I happened to Zahban and Librardon, and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to go with all the architecture. The digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
You think, for example, how they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
The transportation will accelerate, you can take a ship -- an airplane, you can be terrorists.
The technology applied -- you can see in the newspapers, in TV, and in the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
Architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because the architecture is so fast.
It doesn't take a lot of time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before we know what designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
Bracific was not a two-year-old movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much they were arrested.
That's never going to happen again. I think, because we're in the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the ants, the steel or the angle, and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the project to the media, you start to get it faster and faster, until you get to be in both extreme extremes almost in simulation, and you would effectively destroy the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make almost instant symbols -- with emotional charge.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company actually ended up recently.
We were hired to replace this building that turned on.
This is the center of a village called Pines in Firen Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant two years before the building, the building was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly in the finished product, there were no surprise.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, became a means of communication, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you made from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes cortexies with collective memory, and when you charge these symbols.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell them what we think about architecture, because digital media not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those Librardon library.
If that building is built today, we went to the Internet looking for new libraries."
We would be bombarded with examples of experiment, about innovation, about what a library can be.
That's multiplicity.
Multiplicity that can lead to the mayor of Lindanian to the people in Lindanian, and tell them that there is no answers to what can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experiment.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use gratifies and drawing drawings -- and you're no longer a desperate public that doesn't accept something that you haven't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't let you engage for architecture.
That means that the ocean pink of one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that tomorrow buildings are going to be very different than the buildings of today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of Sylvia can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a study in Brooklyn can be that, a study in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick based on ideas of what a stadium should be.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are amazed to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to make sports or to puzzle, or even one can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East River of New York City, and raise half a million dollars of the community around that cause, it's no longer a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of keys, as Muslim and fabulous as animals who are going to look at it.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
The architects know how to make buildings more ecological, smarter and more ambitious.
We've been waiting for all of you to do it.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
They find an architect, control it and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they shape them to the smallest spaces -- the local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my niece, Star.
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does it in that great, typical way of the kids of a year, taking it up, as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally accurate.
And one of the things that he likes to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
It stands and chip, and it gives themselves those big and wet kiss.
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he made me think, "When do I stop doing this?
How do we suddenly don't do with our appearance?
Because apparently we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people look at Google, "Am I fish?
This is Faiza, it's 13 years old and lives in Dender.
And as any teenagers, it just wants to be loved and find.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a bit of fear, it's a bit confused because, even though your mom tells you all the mouse that it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells you that it's ugly.
Among what his mom tells him and what his friends, or what his friends, or the school companies say, don't know who to believe.
So a video of it is, you put it on YouTube, and you ask others to please leave a comment -- "Am I nice or a failure?
Well, so far, Facebook has received more than 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so desperately, that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy teenager, normal and current adults, which gets these answers in one of the stages of their most vulnerable life experiences.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate in this way.
But what are you bringing them to do this?
Well, the teenagers of today almost never are alone.
They are under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, giving me "I love it, buying me, sharing, published, this is never done.
We've never been so connected before, in a continuous way, instantly, so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's kind of a party in his fourth every night.
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from the hand with that are implicational.
This environment, of being always connected, is running into our children to adapt in the number of "I like they have and the kinds of comments they get.
There is no division between a life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it is.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what is made digitally dinosaur.
What is the most frightening thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a daily context.
And where are you looking for inspiration?
Well, you can see the kind of images that are pursuits of the girls of the girls now.
Zero models are still dominating our passions.
The technical technical is now a routine now.
And trends like the strangers, scripture, hydrogen, biological and piece.
For those of you who know it, promise means professionalism.
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people compared to.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the supermarket stars of the sports and the singers reproduced.
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, surely we want our children to grow healthy and be individual individuals.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our children to devote more time and effort to their appearance, to the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other ways start to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see enough enough.
These are not trivial activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as contrary to the society and the field of labor development.
Three percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the classroom. They avoid participating in classrooms because they don't want to call attention for their physical shape.
One in five are not attending to class at all during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season season, if you don't believe you see good enough, specifically if you don't think you're thin enough, you will get a lower note to the average of your peers who are not worried about the appearance.
And this phenomenon has been generated in Finland, United States and China.
And it's independent of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be clear, we're talking about how you see you, not how you really are.
The burning authority about its body is devicing academic performance.
And it's also detrimental health.
The teenagers with time are doing less physical activity, eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more healthy diet than they can take them to a food mess.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily influenced by the people around them, and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think this is about all of this because of what they make most risky decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, dramatic diet, aesthetic surgery, sexual surgery, sexual relations at early age and no protection and automatical damage.
The pursuit of the perfect body is preserving the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not controlling it.
Women who believe that they have a support again, regardless of whether they have or they don't have a higher increase rate.
17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way they see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that opportunity look like?
This potential is about interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking, for itself, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first one is we need to instill trust in their own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of the very well-intentioned programs, not realizing the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow not only will have a positive impact but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are critical departure points for any willing to provide an education in body autonomy that works.
An education is fundamental but facing this problem requires each of us to take the rides in the issue and be a better role model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the emergence of our politicians on hair cuts or the size of your chest, or you can insist that determination or success of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to start judging people for what they are, not as they look like.
We can all start doing it by taking responsibility by the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can choose people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, "When was the last time you were kissing a mirror.
In short, we need to work together as communities, like governments and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children grow to value all of their people, valuing individuality, diversity, inclusion participation.
We need to put people who are actually making the difference in a pedestrian.
Just to make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that come out in the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where they believe that they see that they have never been who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who do you have in mind?
Do you get your wife.
Do you simple?
Do your daughter do?
Your subject? Is it your friend?
It could be just the woman who is two seats. What would it mean for her if it was released from that autonomous voice in its interior, who is attacked by not having long legs long, more thin museums, a stronger floor, smaller toes smaller feet smaller feet smaller feet smaller feet smaller feet smaller feet smaller feet smaller feet smaller feet smaller feet smaller feet smaller feet smaller feet
What would it mean for her if we would overcome this and we would say resident to its potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is holding us all.
But let's teach our children the truth.
Let's teach you that the way you see it is just one part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for whom they are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
We include self-esteem in our schools.
We change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little traces of a year of age today, become the agents of safe change of themselves.
Let's do it.
On November fifth 1990, a gentleman named Star Namas entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the Mere Kahmon, the leader of the League of Defense Justice.
Noam initially declared it innocent but being paid by other minor charges in company from others, started planning attacks at about 12 icon from New York City, including tunnels and synthesis and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those planets were frustrated by an FBI informant for an information.
Sadly, the 1993 bomb in the World Trade Center couldn't be avoided.
Nature would be convicted by his participation in that shot.
School Namas is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 1983, being him an Egyptian engineer, with an American mother, primary school teacher, between the two they did all the possible for giving me a happy childhood.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, which very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in every religion, in every human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are so completely clinging up to their convictions that think that we have to use all the media possible for everyone to live like them.
A few months before the arrest he sat along with me and explained that in the last few weeks, he and some friends, had been going on to train training in Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the California to Carlook that, without knowing our group, was raped by the FBI.
When I got to throw up, my father helped me hold the pen on the shoulder, and explained to me how to aim the target at about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that would trigger the little orange light on the goal, and to surprise all of us, especially me, the whole goal called in flames.
My uncle turned to the others and in Arabic, said "I was "boat?
From such a father, a child.
To everybody, the comment made them a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
They saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could cause my father.
Those people later would be convicted by putting a run with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking of the World Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and hearing another 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called them "moment: it means you.
When I turned 19, I had already moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of amazing.
Every time I started feeling comfortable about someone that was time to push and join another city.
As I was always my new face of the class with frequency was mathematical victims.
I was considered secret my identity to avoid being the white -- but it will be the new of the class, silence and record, was much multiplicity.
So most of the time I spent it at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not develop social skills, to say it super-controlled. To grow under fantasy, I wasn't prepared for the real world.
They educate me to judge people, based on arbitrary indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that were put to test my thinking was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a prevolution program that I participated in the National Convention, Fillerly in Philadelphia.
My group focused on the subject of youth violence -- like I had been victims of killing almost my whole life, which was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various processes.
One day, to the end of the convention -- I discovered that one of the guys who we had done friendship was Jewish, was Jewish.
I took several days to go to light this detail and realized that there was no animation between the two.
I had never been a Jewish friend of mine, and frankly, I was very proud of having been able to sell my barrier that all life had made me believe it was infrastructure.
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in Bush Gardens, a different park.
I met people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures, that experience resulted in the development of my character.
All life had been taught that homosexuality was a sin and, by extension, all of the homosexual excitings were bad influence.
By chance, I had the opportunity to work with homosexual actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most amazing and least critical I'd ever seen in life.
Having been accused of a kid, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others. But it was not easy for me to treat ambitious people, exactly how I wish to be treated.
So I was able to control the stereotypes that had taught me of a child, with the experience of the interaction in real life.
I don't know how to be homosexuality, but I know what is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then I came up with the Daniel Show."
Every night, Jon Stewart made me inherently honest about my international, and he helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my pattern figure at a time when I was desperately needed.
In occasions, inspiration can come from the unexpected, and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, extraction, was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something that I would consider in my heart for always, while she's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough discreters and she said, "I'm tired of hate to hate.
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside your inside.
My real name is not Jack Ebola.
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decide to go out and put myself into a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody who is trying to lead to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way that even though I was led to this violent and intellectual ideology and I didn't get to make me fantastic.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against pressure.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism speaking against those meaningless acts as a rejection to my father's actions.
With this simple I'm exposed to me here as proof that violence is not inherently any religion or race, that children don't have to follow their parents' roads.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Right now, there's a film that is projected in your minds.
It's an incredible multiplication movie.
It's in 3D and it has surreal sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has a shake, taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your hungry, your pleasure.
It has emotions, angry and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that are projected to your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the film is you who experienced everything in directly.
This film is your focus, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you, you and you.
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least, I know I have a consciousness of itself.
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we conscious?
Why do we have these internal films, right?
Why are we not just robots that are processing what we get to produce outcomes without experiencing the internal movie internal film?
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for consciousness.
science, by nature, is goal.
consciousness, by nature, is subjective.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the entire 20th century, they promote that vision.
psychology was studying behavior obviously, neuroscience studied the brain, obviously, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
Then, 20 years ago, everything started to change.
Neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Pennifers said, "Now it's time for science to tackle consciousness.
And since then, there was a real exploration of a scientific job flourishing about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental constraints until the moment.
The center of consciousness science in recent years was the pursuit of correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that Nancy Kanza presented a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of looking at faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a corporation science.
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain and what they correlate.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to neuroscientists.
Actually, there are no easy problems with consciousness.
Because it doesn't take the true central mystery of this matter, why is it that every physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a subjective movie first?
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like buildings, like humanitarians, like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical survival is all cases of emergent behaviors, how they operate by buildings how the humanitarians work, how they reproduce and adapt and metabolic living organisms -- all of these questions about objective operation.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a phenomenon energy, how we walk, how we talk about, how we play chess chess -- they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question why all behavior is accompanied from a subjective experience?
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the surgery, the standard paradigm of neuroscience, doesn't actually have a lot to say.
I'm a heart scientific mathematician.
I want a scientific theory of the administration that works. For a long time, I was hitting my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for systematic reasons.
I think we get stuck at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- we get used to this, and physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
For another, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness, right now, is a kind of animal, something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know yet.
With an analogy like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that initially to be crazy, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such problem with consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective film movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is explain the goals of the brain, the brain behaviors -- and so you study everything you need to explain.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely reductionalized consciousness, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfied.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be promise.
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental legislators, space, time and mass.
They put fundamental laws that government, like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and properties are not explained in terms of anything more basic.
Instead, they consider fundamentalists, and from there is the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is glad.
In the 19th century Machum discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts space, space, time, mass laws, then put the basic laws of the electronics, and I put the electrical load as a fundamental concept that those laws government.
I think that's the situation where we find consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas in terms of fundamental ideas space, space time, mass, burden -- then by the matter of logic, you have to speed the list.
The most natural thing would be to put consciousness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the way to handle it scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass, physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can park them in a spring.
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can park them on a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we look for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision sometimes is called parallels, "Pandot for everyone, permanent person by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the flies -- even the microbes of Rob Knight -- the elementary particles.
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are intelligent or they think.
It's not that a photon can be full of distress when he thinks "Oh, I always travel at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the rolls."
No, that's not.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of creative feeling -- subjective -- some primitive precursor of consciousness.
This can sound a little crazy for you.
How do you think about something so crazy?
It comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental, like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It also is worth noticing that even though the idea seems illegal, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more continuous with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and most powerful way to find fundamental laws that relate to the physical process, is linking awareness with information.
Whenever there is information processing, there's consciousness.
Processing of complex information, like in a human being, complex consciousness.
Simple information processing simple information.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, Girlian Tony, took this kind of theory and development with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measurement of information, which is called a photo, which measures the degree of information embedded in a system.
And I guess it has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there is an incredible degree of information of information, a high high school increase, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a huge average of information integration, equally quite significant degrees of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of paint.
The level of information integration is less, but it's not zero either.
In Tony theory, there's still a different level of consciousness of zero.
It actually provides a fundamental law of consciousness, high degrees of container, high degrees of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that passive parallel can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk to us about the reality that underlies below.
As Stephen Hawking, where the fire fire comes out?
From passive vision, the equations of physics can leave as they are, but they can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts him fire in the equations.
In that view, consciousness is not found out of the physical world as a kind of addiction.
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, public vision, has the potential to transfer our relationship with nature, and it can have pretty serious ethical consequences.
Some can be illegal.
I used to think that I should not eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be vegetable.
If you're a pandemic and you accept that vision, you will have a lot of hunger.
I think that thinking about it, this tends to transform your vision, while what matters in ethical terms and moral consequences, is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the Saturn artificial intelligence system in the High movie.
Is it conscious?
According to the passive information, she has a complicated information processing processing so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have pretty serious ethical problems on the ethics of smart computer systems and the ethics of getting them off.
Finally, you can ask for complete collective collections, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience in a TED Talk, and at this moment we have a TED collective consciousness, an internal movie for this full group of TED, different from the internal films of every single part?
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question that needs to be serious.
So this public vision, it's a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer than the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing, that in the second thing, it's universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love us.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go along the right path towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we finally will go to discover it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we need the right idea right.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in victory.
He had a very normal profile, a perfect education under education.
I went to school, I got together with my friends, fought me with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15, I was a member of my community approached to my parents because I wanted to name for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She hasn't really gotten anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile on my mother's palette, and I spent a lot of time looking at the Buddha Seattle and "Davis Creating."
Yeah, I know. What contraction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can consider as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of teaching in a high school in Melecon, just after 20 minutes in the 11 class of survey studies a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your discussion?
And I said, "What discussion?
Well, I had been talking about the diffusion law for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your motivation speech.
When people in wheelchair are talking about inspiring things in school?
Typically, in the acts of action."
And it was then when I realized, this kid had had experiences with people with disability as objects.
And we are not. And it's not the fault of the kid, that is, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our manipulations.
We're not real people. We're there to inspire it.
And in fact, I'm on this stage looking at what I do in this chair of wheels, and you're probably waiting for you to inspire them. Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid to tell you strategic delivery.
I'm not here to inspire you.
I'm here to tell you that you've been lied in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is bad, Mali, My mass magnet.
It's a bad thing and living with a disability you make you exciting.
It's not something wrong and I can't make it exciting.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad attitude."
Or this one: "Your excuse is invitation."
Or this one another, before I left, interconnection."
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, the girl without hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with orthopedic legs of carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the dominant term unfortunately, because they cost a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we cost the disabled developments of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is to inspire them, motivate them, so we can see them and think, "Well, because of a very bad life, it could be worse.
I could be that person.
But what if you're that person?
I've lost the story of the number of times I have been forced to express that they believe that I am brave or an inspiration source, and this happened to before my work had a public profile.
It was like I'm happy for me to wake up in the morning and remember my own name --  And this is compassionate.
These images, those images cost people with disability for people without disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something hard.
We knew some things.
But the things that we knew are not the things that you might think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term "definitively disappeared, because I subscribe to the so-called social model of disability that tells us that we are more disabilities because of the society we live that because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
And the things I need to do, and I've learned to pull the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They just are using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So is it really fair to figure out how we do that, when we share those pictures?
When people say, "You're a source of inspiration that says it as a complex.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us exceptional.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here building inspiration and you think, "My God, Steve, aren't you at times inspired by something?
And actually, I know I am.
Learning from other people with disability all the time.
However, I don't learn that I'm more lucky than them.
Learning that this is a great idea to use a few pieces of carbon to collect the things that they fall in.  I learn the tragic trick of how to load the mobile phone battery on the battery of the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our diagnosis, but against a world that exceptions and cost us.
I really think that that lie that have sold us about disability is the biggest instance.
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad attitude, the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in the face of a staircase has never made it ever become a rare.
Never    Snow before a television screen is not going to make the supplies for deaf people.
A lot of people in the middle of a free and irrigating a positive attitude to convert all those books to the branch.
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching "Buck The Samara The Silicon Seat doesn't deserve anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we are happy to get away from bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disability and I want to live in a world where a 11 degree kid in a high school in Melder is not a little surprising that its new teacher is a wheelchair user.
Disability doesn't make us exceptional, but to question what you think about what you think about what you do.
Thank you.
What are the augmented reality and the professional football with empathy.
And what is the average speed of a global core without care?
Unfortunately, today just answer one of those questions, so please don't get disappear.
When people think of an augmented reality, think about Meniuschia Report, and in Tom Crisin, including hands in the air, but augmented reality is not fiction.
The augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the augmented reality?
The first step, is what I wear possible: the Google Glass goggles.
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that the Google Glass are a device that allows you to see what I see.
Let me experience what is a professional depression in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to describe them.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will fill with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is going to run through the game of play at 160 miles, the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a 110 pound man chasing us, trying to decide with all its being.
I've been there and I assure you that it's nothing nice.
I bring some videos to show you what the Google Glass is, under the helmet and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, they are not images of NFL practices, because the idea of the New Egyptian technology is a submarine coming up on the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris Kloto: Come on.
It's horrible to be transplanted.
A moment. Let's zoom in a bit.
Do you ready?
Go!
Chris Kloto: As you can see, it's a probability of what is going to be transported in the football field, from the perspective of the table.
You may have noticed that you lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, cortex from Washington University.
Field marine" from fiction: mice 54: Matters 54."
Blue eight, Blue E." Come on.
Chris Kloto: This is a little bit more about feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being at NGO.
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be their favorite players, and they've asked me in YouTube and Twitter and you can see from the angle of a field butterfly.
or a corner?
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with Google and Google Glass, how do we get out of the full level? How do we take it to the next level?
We took it to that level by using something called Octootic Richard, which probably many of you know.
The October Rich has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not a cheap word.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, oh.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep playing. No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
CK: That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain standing for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we record an Adrian Peter video crossing the line, getting rid of a tape with the arm before they run and make an antibiotics? What will be the experience of a fan.
When I can be Messardon running through the shell, launching the bullet at the bottom of the network, or Federal doing a sand in Wikipedia?
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles as a Olympic screen?
Maybe you increase the pale sales for adults.
But this is not still augmented reality.
It's just virtual reality, RNA.
How do we reach augmented reality, RS?
We will achieve the augmented reality when the coaches and the males and the owners see the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our teams better?
How do we use it to win participants?
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here's a brief report about the technology at NBA.
In 1965, Babbage's Potters put him a wrist to their field marine to play faster.
They won Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to imitate them.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, NASA put radio on the helmet of the fields of the field and then in the defenses.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In 2013, imagine you're a player coming back to your group and you see their next player shown in front of you, in a plastic visit that they are wearing, no longer you will have to worry about forgetting a player.
Or to memorize strategy.
They just go out to the field and react.
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate losing participants.
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual strategy manual.
The augmented reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
What would it do?
Well, a very simple option would be having a camera on every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the sheet sensors and the admins, something that's already working already.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know to send it.
The bad people will be supporting information.
This will differentiate the good teams of bad equipment.
So your team of computer will be as important as your records, and the data analysis will stop being for nerves.
It's going to be for sports. Who would have imagined it?
What would it be like in the field.
Imagine that you're the family of field.
You get the balance and retreat.
You look at an open receptor. Suddenly a flower on the left of your bombsight is going to warn you that a defense behind you is going to attack -- normally, you wouldn't see it, but the Rio system gets you around.
Fast to the protection area.
Another floating floating is that there's an open receptor.
You throw the bullet out, but you would give you a lot.
The bullet loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, though, the receptor sees in its visit an area of grass that lights up and can modify the career.
You get approached, you catch the bullet and run and announce.
The public put it and the fans have followed the player from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'll get lots of people to see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be their favorite player.
augmented reality will be part of the sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of augmented reality?
Are we going to use it just as bread and circuit, like our usual entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use the augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, being in another person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for sports logic.
It generates billions of revenues a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show an abuse of how harmful their actions are from the perspective of victim?
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia.
How much is true for a Commander Haitifan or a Neil Degree Twitter trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of traditional notes and Karachus?
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality.
The questions we do, the decisions that we take and the challenges that we face, depend on, as always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently retired after 23 years of service at the High Pacific of California.
The majority of those 23 years ago I had spent the southern end of the Marian County, which includes the Golden Gates bridge.
The bridge is an iconic structure, mostly known by its beautiful visions of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and his inspired architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also an imam for suicide, one of the most used places in the world.
The Goldman Gates Bridge was open in 1973.
Joseph Stress, engineering head of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is virtually to suicide test.
The suicide from the bridge is not practical or problem."
But from their openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take it to another dimension -- this bridge has been identifying as such as such that the every single single one of it releases you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that are going on underneath your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a four to five seconds, the body crosses against the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bone, some of which they lose vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
Those of you who don't normally cut into the water and then get shocked.
I don't think that the people who are contemplating this method of suicide are aware of the death march that they will face.
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to take their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is in that edge, and at the darkest time, it's very difficult to bring them back.
I took this picture last year as this young man talked to an officer with her life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the dragon.
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
We struggled to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who contemplating suicide, but the officials as well.
We've traveled a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new offices.
This is Jason Garbara.
I met him the 22 of July last year when he got a call from a possible suicide subject sitting on the heart near the center.
I answered, and when I arrived, I looked at Jason talking to an official of the Google Gates officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and I had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here two times before New Jersey to try to suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to Jason and asked us if we knew the story of the Pandora's box.
remembering the Greek mythology, Ze created Park, and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, "You never open that box.
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than Park, and she opened the box.
She came out of plastics, pinkers, and all kinds of bad against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no hope?
It stopped a few instances, it turned on to the right, and it was.
This mad and intelligent boy in New Jersey just took out of life.
I spoke to Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how he was.
Jason parents had asked them.
Collaboration damage damage affects many people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or a friend or a friend or a friend of a friendly?
What would you say?
You know what to say?
In my experience, not only to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't argue, first, or tell the person you know how you feel, because you probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point you need.
If you think somebody's surface, you don't have afraid to face them and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, others in circumstances have thought about ending your life, you've had these thoughts?
confront the person in front of it can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to look for it, despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to improve -- importance, believing that there is nothing you can do about it, recent social isolation, and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I received an email of a lady and I'd like to read her letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with his permission and benefit that I read it.
"Hi, Kevin -- I think you're at TED conference.
It must be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell many people and go home to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still pretty inspiring, but I notice more moments of realizing that Mike really won't go home.
Mike was driving from Peter to San Francisco to see the 99 percent of his father on January 19.
It never came there.
I called the Police Police and reported it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house, and they reported me that the microscope of Mike was down on the bridge.
A witnesses had seen him jumping from the bridge to 1850s in the afternoon of the previous day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who may be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been bad without suffering a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The GGB, the Golden Golden Bridge has to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a cemetery cement.
Good luck this week, Victoria."
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and turn the way her son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man I mean hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, responded to a radio call by a possible substance suicide in the bridge of the bridge near the northern tower.
I drove my engine on the sidewalk, and I looked at this man, Kevin Bertie, standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, I immediately immediately shrinking her danger, and she stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the next time, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided that he will come back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, he happy.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said, "What was it that made it come back and give the hope and the life of the other opportunity?
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I hear me.
You let me talk and just listen.
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the Metaphor mother, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to read you.
"Dear Smart British, nothing will erase the events of the 11th of March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
I think I think Kevin was calling for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness, which has been properly medicated.
I adopted Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious of all those historical traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We thank God for you.
In debt with you, Narrator Bertie."
And at the end she wrote, "P. When I visited the General Hospital of San Francisco that night, you would figure out like the patient.
"I think I did have to fix it."
Today, Kevin is a characteristic father and active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and his depression to hope that his story inspired others.
The suicide is not just something that I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather is suicide with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, I stole the opportunity to know it.
This is what the suicide does.
For most of the suicide people, or those who consider the suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want their own pain to end.
Usually this gets only three ways: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental diseases and supermarket calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved in, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was Jason.
The other was a man he talked about about an hour.
During that time, I shook my hand in three occasions, right?
In the final airport, I looked at me, and he said, "Keenel, I feel it, but I have to go."
And I jumped out.
Horrifie, absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we are to contact on that bridge are not supposed to be supposed.
In addition, those few people who have jumped out of the bridge and living and that they can talk about it, that one or two percent, most of those people have said to the second that the second they left that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge not only connects Mary with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that every single one of us should be striving to do.
The suicide can be prevented.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but in your inside you know what you are, and a question is like, "How do you become that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in no way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever been a child.
My outside finally agreed with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, which I refer later, when I look at this picture I think -- the George George -- you get it, you get it.
But the October, I discovered that I am just starting.
We are all excited to our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of freedom, to get rid of limitations tax by the color of the skin or the beliefs of those who surround us.
They are people who are always challenging the status quo.
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, even ignored my story.
I think this enemy is called reversality.
This is mine.
And they recorded me as a kid at birth because of my genital generations.
I remember my five years in Los Fiscans, in my house, I always carried this shirt in my head.
And my mom asked me, "Why are you always wearing that truck in your head?
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a girl.
I knew how to admire it.
Gender always has considered an amazing fact, but now we know that, really, is something more complex and mysterious stuff.
Because of my success, I never dare to share my story, not because I thought I'm going to be the bad thing, but because of how the world deals with those of us who want to liberate them.
Every single day to be a woman.
I have Mom and Dad and a family who accepted me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of the gender.
There's a Buddhist diversity of compassion.
There's a Hindu god, dialogue of the diarying.
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries to them.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something would hit me -- this is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, I met this woman named T.
It's the director of a conventional beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the beauty concept?
He told me that if she participated her was going to fall out of the insulin and the vessel costs, and that night, she won on the bathroom suit, she won in galaxy suit, and she was third of a third of the candidates between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty retires.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was of beauty of the trained women, but I can.
I also met the discovery goddess -- especially when we traveled to remote provinces of the Filmerchoods.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom, who had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me that they approved my request of the green card that I could go live in the United States.
I was resistant to me.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm fun.
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a beauty revenue."
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you moved to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of gender?
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested me that I put two "god to my name.
She also accompanied me when I operated in Thailand, at 19 years old.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand perform the most prestigious surgeries, sophisticated and safe.
At the time in the U.S., it was necessary to make surgery before changing the name and the gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license.
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity documents means being able to drive or be able to get a drink, but for me it was the license to live, to feel dignity.
Suddenly, my fears were mentioned.
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman with Alley's Alice Networks.
A young woman from New York who was worth his truth, but that, depressed, put his life over.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November, we do a global surveillance for the Congration Day of The Transplant.
I'm in this stage thanks to a long story of people who fight and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marshall P. Johnson and Sylvia River.
Today, at this same time, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame.
I'm here, expanding me, so that there is no more surveillance.
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  KT: Gene, a quick question.
George Rocket: Sure. You see, first, thank you with all my benefits.
My support network, my parents, to my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the time I've been attending young women who were trained women, who I've reached -- and sometimes when they called me and told me that their parents couldn't accept it. I took the phone, I would call my mom and said, "Mommy, you can call this woman?"
Sometimes it worked, other times -- it's just gender identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender by birth, and what I try to do is put the table on the table that sometimes that kind of animal anti-shot, and there should be a space that allowed people to addition it, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The tragic movement is starting compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work for doing.
It should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you.
In many patriarchal and tribal societies, the parents generally are known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
Malawi started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007, and when his efforts were manufactured in 2011, when he was able to convince the National Prize of peace, he became very famous -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we look at the history of humanity, the history of women is the history of injustice.
You see, in the patriarchal societies, right from the beginning, when he was born a girl, his birth is not celebrated.
It's not welcome not for his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes -- gives its mothers and no one's happy to the father.
And a mother was overwhelming a lot to have a child.
When I give birth to the first child, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, they compared, and with the hope of a son, when he smells his third daughter, it feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the mother suffer but the daughter -- the daughter was born, when it grows, it suffers as well.
At the age of five, when I should go to school, it stays home and the school admit to his sisters.
Even 12 years old, in some ways, has a good life.
You can get fun.
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when I served 13 years, he was banned to get out of his house without a male accountable.
It's confined at four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It turns into his father of his father and his brothers and his family, and if he transported the code of that supposedly honor, he could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this assumption of honor, not only affects the life of a girl, also affects the life of male male members of family.
So this brother sacrifice the joy of his life and the happiness of his sisters in name of the supposedly honor.
And there is more of the pathological societies that are called obesity.
A good girl is supposed to be very quiet and very humble and very subtle.
It's the critic.
The model of a good girl must be heat.
It's supposed to be silent and accept the decisions of your father and your mother and the decisions of the elderly, even if you don't want.
If you have a man who doesn't like or if the house with an old man, it has to accept it, because it doesn't want to be slowly shot.
If the very young house has to accept it.
Otherwise, you call it desperate.
And what happens at the end?
In words of a poetry," "The House, the embarrassment, and then gives birth to more children and daughters."
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, include the same of the object to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
dear brothers and sisters, when malaria, and for the first time, believe me, I didn't like the newborn neighbors, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked up and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely honored to me.
And long before he was born, I thought about her name, and she was fascinated with a legendary struggle of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was Malawi from Manhattan, and I called my daughter like that.
But when I looked at it, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I brought a line out of my name, and I wrote, Malia."
And when she grew up, when she was four and a half years ago, she admitted in my school.
You might wonder, why should I mention a girl in a school in a school?
Yeah, I should mention it.
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the patriarchal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for a child life.
In a school means the recognition of its identity and his name.
A school to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and aspirations where they can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five brothers, and none of them were able to go to school, and they would be surprised, two weeks earlier, when the Canadian bombsight form, and I was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the applications of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen my sisters written in any document in any document.
That was the reason I value my daughter.
What my father could not give my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate intelligence and safety of my daughter.
He encouraged him to sit when my friends came to see me.
He encouraged to go with me with different meetings.
And all of these values, I've been trying to get involved in your personality.
And this was not just for her, just for Mala.
I've driven all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for emotion.
I taught my daughters, teaching students, to forget the lesson of the office.
And I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called sound.
dear brothers and sisters, we fought for more rights for women, and we struggled to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and particularly for women's rights.
It was called the talk.
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all political activities and economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use candles and stopped going to markets.
The musicians were silent, the beat girls and the singers killed.
They suffered millions, but few talking, and it was terrifying to have those people who kill and hate when you speak for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, Malawi got up and went through the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC blog, he offered herself for the New York Times documentaries and talked about every platform I could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It spread like a club around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign and ninth of October 2012, they shot him on the head.
It was a fatal day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was devicing between life and death, I will whisper to my wife to my wife -- "Should I blame for what happened to my daughter to your daughter?
And he just told me, "Please don't blame you.
Defining the right cause.
You put your life in play for the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter will inspire you and join you.
Both of them were on the right road and God the protection."
These few words meant a lot for me, and I did not ask again.
When Malawi was in the hospital and he had severe pain and strong pain headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was extended by the face of my wife.
But my daughter was never complained of.
I used to tell them, "I'm fine with my stranger smile and my face.
I'm going to get right. Please don't worry.
It was a conservation for us, and it was consumed.
dear brothers and sisters, we've learned from it how to resist at the hardest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for children and women, it's like any 16.
I cry when he doesn't finish his homework.
You fight with your siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special in my tutor that has done so audacious to Malawi so courageous, expressive and equation?
I tell you, don't ask me what I did.
Ask me what I didn't do.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was operating the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I have recently joined the Monterey group from Google, where I've had a divide to my charge -- the visualization of Google X, Google X, but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma when you stand to a brain operation.
Are you still as clever or not?
It wouldn't be like that, could you be smart.
After neuroscience, I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It was not gray matter, but it was the sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and neuroscientists.
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I have had to decide about combinations and chemicals of chemicals, and try to get it, to follow with life.
More than once I've been saved by time.
But luckily, I have an experimental soul, so I decided I would experience to try to get the optimal doses because it doesn't really exist a clear map that says it in detail.
I started testing with different mixes -- and I was surprised by seeing how small changes in the dose would dramatically change my automatic, my sense of who I am, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly impressive case, for a few months, I tried to take doses and typical chemicals for a man of version, and I was surprised to see how they changed my thoughts.
I was always furniture, I thought all the time in sex -- and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several kinds of guys like this, or maybe some trained versions in the past.
It turned out to be an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be angry.
In fact, I was trying to get a problem with a problem that I had in front of it, and it just didn't happen like this.
So, I couldn't handle it.
I changed my dose.
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to go through.
What I was trying to do, when you adjust those hormones and neuroscientists and so on, was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the operation -- my creative thought, my ideas flow of ideas.
I tend to think about almost in images, and that became my key point of reference -- how do you get those mental images that I use to create profoundly, my ideas, if you want to want to test new ideas and recreating situations.
This kind of thinking is not new.
Philosophers like Huma, Descartes and Hostalisms see things like this.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
There are people who are questioning this idea, and there are many discussions about how the mind works. For me it's simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental for creative thinking and invention.
So after several years, I managed to find the right point and I have lots of great mental memories, really vivid and well sophisticated and good.
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images, of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use his imagination only to direct the world it has the front?
Or if a musician could extract the music of their head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments made by two developed groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, image by functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain, and here you can see the brain scan done by Giantemen Gandos and his Harvard colleagues.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The middle column shows the brain scanning of the brain of that same individual while imagining that same image.
The column on the right is created by reinventing the contents of the central column of the left -- you see that the difference is almost non-relative.
This was repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost non-relative.
Now, let me share another experiment. This is the lab of Jack Galling in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into recognition visuals.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were escaping their brains to create a great accept of brain reactions to video sequences.
Then you showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as long as a new scan was recorded.
The computer -- using just brain information of the stage I was able to show it to show what seemed that the person was seeing.
On the right, you can see the computer decodes, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left boards.
We're pretty close to it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image, and when you imagine that same picture, it creates in the brain the same map.
This was conducted with the major brain scanning systems that are available today, and their resolution was embedded as a thousand times over the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we do that?
There are many techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes to it.
I don't offer myself for that.
A lot of people are providing new projection techniques for images, even me by telling with the recent result of the MRI -- first we should ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the way?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, larger magnets provide small improvements in the resolution, not increase by thousands of us like we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger images, we do better images.
We can create a lot more complex structures with slightly different arrangements.
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in the MRI were to make really big pictures, right?
However, most recent advances in international solutions and brilliant solutions in education and deconstruction and decoding in the transitions and frequency frequencies of the MRI systems.
In turn, instead of a unific magnetic field, we use magnetic patterns tied to the FM radio frequencies.
So when you combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the FM radio processing patterns, we can actually increase the information that you can extract in a single stage.
Also, we can then split in layers of our growing knowledge about the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the IMF we should be able to measure not just the flow of oxygenation -- but the of the hormones and neuroscientists that I mentioned and maybe even neural activity. This is sleep.
We will be able to fly our ideas directly into digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly through thinking about thinking.
What would we be capable of?
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without filter?
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's cure and similar disease.
We have a few choices more than opening this door.
Anyway, choose a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about this night about coming out of the closet, and not a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have arms.
His army may be saying to some person for the first time or saying to someone who's pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other conversation that you have in your life.
All armed is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary transmitted, the experience of having lived and out of that arm is a universal thing.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it should happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked at the South Side Wall Capt, a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through a number of stages of the life military intensity -- I wouldn't trace my armpits -- I would quote the letters of Abu I Frank as a laty.
And I will be aware that because of the muscle of my short screen and I had my head on my head, I would ask normally a little kid, "Hey, you're a guy or girl?
And it appears an uncomfortable silence on the table.
I would take my jaw a little more, I would take my coffee with a rabbi leave.
The father would take the newspaper, and the mother would wash a cold looking at his son.
But I would not say anything, and it was here.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
It would have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"Are you a guy or a girl?
A family silence, but this time I was ready and I was about to enter the female issues on the table.  I had Betty Friedman quote.
The Gloria Stein quote.
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monsoons that I showed you.
And then I breathe down, and I went down the gaze and my backs a four year-old girl with a pink dress, looking at me what is not a challenge for a feminist grief, just a girl with a question, "Are you guys or girl?
And so I would breathe back to me again, and I got out of the boxes near her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a confident thing.
I have the hair hair like a boy, and I see a kid, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Well, I'm more than a girl of a comfortable piano.
And that girl looked at me fired, paying attention, and he said, "My favorite piano is violent and has a fish.
Can you give me a panel, please?
And that was it. Just "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the pandemic that I asked?
It was the easiest difficult conversation of all I ever had.
And why? Because the girl of the pandemic and I, both of the panels and I, were honest with each other.
As many of us, I've lived in some arms in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a rainbow.
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how a guy feels like living in a closet.
That's how my arm is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I mean, I'm going to give you 100 reasons from why to get out of my closet, more difficult than stepping out of the own, but this is the thing: The hard is not relative to it.
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has been declared in broken banking is harder than saying it's been angry?
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is more difficult than telling your son of five you're going to dive you?
There is no more difficult thing -- there is only how hard.
We need to stop classifying what is hard to be able to make it hard to make us feel better or worse in relation to our closet, and we should just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in arms, and they may make you feel security, or at least more security than you offer the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what their walls are made, an army is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I had a horse tail, a dress and high shoes.
It was not the military lesbian prepared to fight any four year-old boy who would go into coffee.
I was frozen by the fear, curled in a corner of my dark closet, pushing my gay grid, and moving only one muscle is the most scary thing I ever have.
My family, my friends, strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to do to try to tell them, and now the world would turn back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that brand, you kill you.
One of my most memorable recording launches was in my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that many of the guests between the guests knew that I was gay, and when I did my honor piano workers, in my black and tail picture, I walked around the tables and finally came to a where the friends of my parents' friends, people who met me for years.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women scream.
And the battle of the gay relationship had begun.
"Ah, once you were in the Case?
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San Francisco.
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's fabulous."
"Hey, you know my state Atlantic station?
It's very good and never talked about having a nice."
"Ah, what is your favorite TV program.
Our favorite program Will and Greece.
And you know who you love us? Jack.
Jack is our favorite."
And then a woman, disappeared, but in hopes of showing desperately his support, to make me know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses pink shirts."
And I had an opportunity at that time, as you have all the graduate landscapes.
It might have been easy to indicate where they felt messaged.
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were strangled.
And what else can you ask someone, but to serve?
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for how authentic you get.
It's kind of like the hard conversations still remain my strong point.
Ask anyone I have come out with.
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Chinese girl.
Now, please look at this through gay perspective, but you understand that what you mean out of any harmony is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
Keep your armed. Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no army, but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be general, the others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be direct -- just give it. Just give it to it. Just take it off.
If you know they are gay, tell it.
If they say to their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give you a sense of hope hope.
And number three, and more importantly,  leave the complex.
You communicate your truth.
You never apologize for that.
And some of them can go out safe wounds -- except for what they've done, but they never apologize for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel declared, but something in them, not you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in an MRI dark, you have to know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, but they're not.
Thank you, Boulder. Enjoy the value.
intelligence, what is that?
If you look at the history of how intelligence has been seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote of Edison Dishrons that the question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim.
When Edgar Dish wrote this made it as a criticism to the pioneers of computer like Alan Turing.
And so, a few years ago, I started a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you are from an alien race, which you don't know about the biology of Earth or neuroscience on Earth, but you have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so they can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as terrorists, we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from an alien race that you don't know about this, that you don't have any concept on Earth intelligence -- you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to some point in time, the asteroids that demonstrate the surface of a planet mainly stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I took a number of years ago, I analyzed a variety of topics through science, through various disciplines, which saved, I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In cosmology there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be finally adjusted for intelligence development, and in particular, for development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the robotic movement planning, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action to make a complex task.
And so by taking all these different issues and putting them together, I asked, for a number of years, there is a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all of these different themes of issues.
Is there just an equation for intelligence.
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = my intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is an claim that intelligence is a force, F that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the open choices, with a diversity of you, with the diversity of possible future accessible future, yes, to an impending future time, takes.
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to stay stuck.
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain open choices.
And so by having this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How predictable is it?
Does it predict the level of human intelligence?
Does artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: Recent research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more descend, or "anteromed: during their life should have a tendency to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that collective cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence is a deeper relationship to a deeper relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the long-term entropy production, but actually emerges from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called Entrance, designed to maximize the long-term entropy production in any system in which it's located inside.
Amazingly, Entrance could pass multiple animal intelligence testing, playing human games, and even making money sharing action, all of that without being told to do that.
Here are some examples of Earth in action.
Just like a feet of foot without married, here we see Extraordinary balancing automatically by using a cartoon.
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave Electrolux a goal.
He simply decided to balance the position.
This equilibrium ability will have applications for humanitarian robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate through the opposite opposite of a rope at the same time to release food, here we see extractive entrepreneurs can perform a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and a variety of other fields.
Exponential is widely applicable to a variety of domains.
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of punishment against itself, including its potential for play.
Here we see Extraordinary to organize new connections in a social network where friends are constantly disappeared and successfully keeping the network connected network.
This same network organization also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see Entraphrauce organizing the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering successfully and using Panama Canal to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, Entrance is widely applicable to problems in autonomous defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see Entrepher spontaneously discover and execute a computer strategy, ventilated in a simulated series of action negotiation -- successfully increasing assets under its exponentially.
This risk of risk management will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex Wisseneers," what you've seen is that a variety of intelligent human behavior human behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all derive from one equation that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound irony here.
So let's go back at the beginning of the use of the robot term, the U.K. work -- there was always the concept that if we developed intelligent machines, there would be a cyber rebellion there.
Machines get up against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had the whole concept of cyber rebellion to investment.
It's not that machines first become intelligent and then magicians and they're trying to get out of the world.
It's all the opposite -- that the impulse of taking control of all future possible is a principle more fundamental than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly to take control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
And they often ask me, "How is it that looking for goals disappeared from this kind of market?
My equivalent to that statement to help us build artificial intelligence or help us understand the human intelligence, is this: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in its own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the continue of stars and losing the planet we call home.
But in the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of potential planets that orbit around other stars, which points that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the light intensity of stars when planets go ahead of them, and block a little bit of that light that comes in.
The data collected by Kepler show the size of planets in addition to the distance between them and their stem star.
In together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocks like the terrestrial planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light they get from their sun.
In turn, this gives you clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we are finding this test of potentially habitable worlds, our own planet is leading under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014, it was the most caloried record.
Glass glasses and ice that have been with us for the millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have quickly overcome our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a climate scientist, no astronomy.
I study the ability of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I look for alien opportunities in the immediate sector.
Now, as somebody really interested in the quest of life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for similar planets to the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invited a comparison between the newly discovered planet and planets that we know better."
Take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and rock and despite being a little further from the Sun, you can consider a potentially habitable world shown this by a mission like Kepler.
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied Mars so much to Mars.
Our Rover Russians are tracking their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that orbit it, like the MMAOO mission, take samples from the atmosphere of the Martian atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their ability.
The private companies now offer not only a short space but also the chance of living on Mars.
But even though all these marine images remind us the desert of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the logical ideas and purposes, compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the destructive areas of our planet that are still going to be contributed, places in comparison to Mars.
Even in the driest and most elevated places on Earth, the air is fresh and represented oxygen by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this enthusiasm for Mars collection and other planets with a big short shadow, the implications and the belief of some that Mars waiting out there to save us from this influence of the only planet that we know is really habitable -- the Earth.
For much that I like intellectual exploration, I'm deep disappeared with this idea.
There are many good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to save humanity is how to imagine that the catastrophe of the Titanic will tell us that the truth of the Titanic will be able to get place later in the wild.   Thank you.
But the targets for interstellar exploration and terror pressure are not contributing.
No, they're actually expensive to the same currency -- the goal to understand and preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like extraterrestrial parameters.
They're just getting closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces, in the hostile areas and installations of land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a mental experiment, the February paradox.
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, considering that our universe has been for a long time, and we hope that there was a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the February paradox is that when civilizations become so advanced enough to consider living among stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of planets that drive this development.
It's arrogant to think that only intellectual colony will save us from ourselves, but planetary preservation and intellectual exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to overcome the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the even easier task to preserve the ability on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own house.
And while I was in the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where I had left them.
So I quickly tried to open all the other doors and windows and all of them were very closed.
I thought about calling a close, at least I had my cell phone, but to the midnight, a close could take a long time to get in, and I made cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had a flight early on Europe in the next morning, and I was preparing from my passport and my suitcase and my suitcase and my suitcase and my suitcase and my suitcase and my suitcase and my suitcase and my suitcase and my suitcase and my suitcase and my suitcase and my suitcase and my suitcase
It would take expensive, but I sure no more expensive than a certain at night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I was going to go out well stop.
I'm a professional neuroscientist, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
Control releases that increases heart rhythm, modulate levels of adrenaline and cloud thinking.
And when I got to the show of factority in the airport, I realized that I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking myself, if there was something that could do, systems that could put in place, that they prevent bad things happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen, which minimize the likelihood that it's a total catastrophe.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts were not criticized.
I was dinner with my colleague Danny Katrini, won from the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed told him that I broke my window, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called prospective representative.
It's something he had learned from psychologist Gary Klein, who had written this a few years earlier, also known as the promise.
Everybody knows what's the post-off.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the spring, as Danny explains -- you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might go wrong, and then try to figure out what can do to prevent that things happen or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about with you is some things we can do in the form of a primate.
Some of them are evident. Some are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, I will take a place for the things that are easily lost.
This sounds common as a common sense, but there's a lot of science supporting this thesis -- based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of important things -- where the fish are, which applies the fruit trees, where the tribes live and enemies live.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is added in the London tablets.
It's the part of the brain that allows the squirrel to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the annual sense of the squirrel and still find their nuts.
They didn't use the alien, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing the car, reading glasses and passengers.
So at home they get a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a decorative dish.
For your passport, a particular coal.
For your reading glasses, a particular mess.
If you take a place and they're survival with it, your things will always be there when you look for them.
What about travelings?
Take the phone a picture of your credit cards, like driving down, passenger, send it by email to yourself so you're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or stealing them, this can be easier to find out.
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases curtain.
The curtain is toxic and interpretation thinking.
So part of the primary practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the best time, and we have to put the systems on their site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical attention or a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is written as a project for all of medical decisions, and in fact for the decision of financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision you have to take from which you benefit a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have received the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit."
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with greater risk of cardiovascular diseases, attack to the heart, brain injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to get a drug that will help you reduce the colleague, a station."
And maybe you have heard about the stations, and you know that it's one of the most recent drugs in the world today -- even you're likely to know people who take them.
So you think, "Yes, I remember the station."
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should ask for most doctors to do not want to talk, and pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for NASA, the number needs to treat.
And what is this, the NAND?
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or join surgery in any medical procedure before it helps a person.
And you should think about what kind of described statistics is that?
The number must be one.
My doctor wouldn't tell me anything if I wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's guilty of somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood the underlying mechanism.
But the William estimates that 90 percent of drugs work only 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely decentralized, what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before it helps a person?
300 percent.
This is about the research of cynical researchers Jerusalem Grounded and Pamela Harvard, confirmed independently by Block.
I explore the numbers.
300 people have to take medicine for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, brain or another adverse event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one chance in 300 of a lower my colleague.
Why not, doctor? Give me the recipe anyway.
But then you have to ask for one more statistics, and it is, "Her second "Selling Eastern Easter: Yes?
For this particular drug, side effects are produced in five percent of patients.
And those include things include music and muscle pain and articulate pain, painful pain, but now they think, "Twenty percent is not very likely to go to me, still take the medicine."
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how they would look at this over time, so they don't have to make the reasoning chain in the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has helped you, five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that help you medicine.
I don't say they should or not take the station.
I just say you have to have this conversation with your doctor.
Medical ethic requires it, it's part of the very informed consent principle.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number needs to be quite typical.
For the surgery that most of us are done in men older than 50 men, it will spread from prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is 40.
So 49 surgeries by a person who has helped it.
And side effects in that case, they produce in 50 percent of patients.
They include the momentum or disconnective education, army inconsistence, straight lock -- fecal local.
And if it's lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just last year or two.
So the idea of the promise is to think before the questions that you can plan to drive the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this in the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have an option of a lot of times, want a shorter life free to pain, or a longer life that could be much pain to the end?
These are the things you talk about and think about now, with your family and your loved ones.
You can change you in the heat of the moment, but at least you are trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases cortical releases under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face to face with a predator. It doesn't need the digestive system, or the liberation or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react to rapidly. They could be the lunch of lions so nothing matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go through the window during those moments of stress is the rational logical thought, like Danny Kanzahkson and their colleagues have shown.
So we need to train ourselves to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all deforestation.
We're all going to fail at the fail of time.
The idea is to think about the future how those false fails, to put the systems in the place that will help you minimize the damage or to help minimize the bad things happen in the first place.
Retrigaly the night of snow in Montreal -- when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination next to the door, with a keys of the entry door in the same one, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered -- and lots of email messages I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized. But I see the organization as a gradual process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: Pinan, "Ph: Pain is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing super-controlled.
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a couple of pair in the particular, you need to play more gently to play.
Two -- even more gentle.
Four -- extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree -- there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of sand may have never come to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of silence, a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, the Alice, besides a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came up for the 1800s, and over the time of time, he mixed up with local signs, and the language that we know today is Alabama.
So it has a story of about 200 years.
I was born deaf, and they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize now that it's not true at all.
Sound is a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a deaf person who lives in a world of sound, it's like I live in a foreign country, is following their rules, cosmous, behaviors and norms without them.
So how do I understand the sound.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my highways and they amplify sound.
Learning and copy that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people respond to them.
So I've learned for example.
"Don't beat the door."
"Don't make a lot of noise at eating the friend of friendship bag."
"Don't error, and when you're eating it, you don't throw the covers on the dish.
All of this is called the sound "street?
Maybe I think of sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super survey of sound.
And I'm always waiting with nervous the sound, which is about coming next.
From there, this drawing.
TED, to decide with.
TBP, to continue.
TED, for announcing.
You can see that the performance doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines are already contained through subtle edges and managers.
In the deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the piece of perspective in the Alzheimer's Alask.
A typical picture has five lines.
However, to me to do this with my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic resistance there.
Before this time, I had worked as a painter.
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different galleries and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that was called the attention.
There was no visual art, everything was auditory.
Now the sound has entered my art territory now.
Is I going to distance more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't just experience through the ears.
I can feel a technical way, or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the ownership of sound and integrate it into my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me about how to sound, I decided to leave it and get it off.
I started to create a new body body.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, it was impressed with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, control, social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was a stranger, it was something of a listener person.
And sound is so powerful that it could be demonstrating me and my artistic work, or I could get worse.
I chose to be pregnant to me.
There's a massive culture around the language spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me from equal and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, at work and institutions, I work with many different interpretations from ALS.
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be heard.
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask you to borrow your voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I didn't continue this practice, I feel that I could stay in the forgotten and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, depth in the music world.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and ALS.
For example, a musical note can not capture and express fully on paper.
And the same thing can be said from a concept at ALS.
The two are very spatial and highly modified meaning that subtle changes can affect all the meaning both of the signals as the sound of sound.
I'd like to share a piano metaphor, so that they understand better how the ATlo works.
So, imagine a piano.
The DNA is divided in many different grammar parameters.
If you assign a different parameters for each finger as you touch the piano as the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand, the speed, the shape of your hand, the English is a linear language, as if you would just put a keyboard at a time.
However, the CIA is more like a coach, you need the 10 fingers in a simultaneous way to express a clear concept or an idea at ALS.
If only a keyboard would change the street, create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of tone and temperature and volume.
At Alzheimer's using these different grammar parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal is at it."
This is the signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
Look at it.
Oh, I was captured.
E: Oh Oh.
What are you looking for?
Ah, based."
So I got to think, and if I look at the ATlo through the lens of the music?
If I had to create a sign and repeat it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of day, the sun comes out and gets over.
This is all day."
If you repeat it and reduce speed, you visually look like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can tell me about "All night.
"All night.
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think of about three different guys at night, "And "I was all night --  "All night.
I feel that the third has more music than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed at ALS and how distance to body can express changes in time.
For example, one hands is a hand, two heroes -- it's two hands, the present becomes closest and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is a long time ago.
Then, past past, "Audience "A and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, "A time."
Common time: it's a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times per companies.
However, when I see the word common time: I think automatically at "the same time.
Look at MT: hand right hand. MK: left.
We have the pandemic through the head and the chest.
(Cautist: MT, brown flow "Flar, "Movement Caltech: El grass grass I'm going to show you a form of the hand called "flat "grade?
Can you do it with me?
All the hands in high school.
Now we're going to do it both in the head as the chest, something like common time."
Yeah, very good.
That means "embracing in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all the cultures and signs of signs around the world.
The second that I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means collision in the ALS.
Now, third one. Please follow me again.
And again.
It's "little in the Alzheimer's Latin.
We're going to do the three together.
"Love and collaboration and light."
Good job.
Look how the three signs are very similar. Everyone happens in the head and the chest -- but they transmit very different meaning.
It's amazing to see how the HIV is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very autonomous world.
And just because the A.I. has no sounds, automatically has no social value.
We need to begin to question what social value defines and allow the Alexande to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this might be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn ALS.
The NSA is a remote risk and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall out of us.
Thank you.
Dean Khahaiin: Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said, "You can put it all up, but then you have to clean it."
Liberation involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence bubble or an ignorance bubble I should say, because adults lie to us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also expand and that they're not very good at cleaning each other.
The time I went on, I am now adults and teach in the Harvard Kong.
You don't have to wait for my students to walk on the beach of the beach with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we clean the beach, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I didn't tell it.
It's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans are plastic.
It's a slow thing.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big bubbles and networks, to collect those plastic pieces to study them under the microscope, and we classify them and we collect this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge boat.
So with my students, with ages of six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this massive work message for the very short kids to be able to participate.
And I'm going to tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools are great and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to the plastics.
We collected the plastic and we reduce it to the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its fragile.
So we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to combine them into something we expect it to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, we just collect information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this plastic -- kids are very excited about robots.
Then we created quickly what we call a prototype."
We are so fast in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we transform laboratories and chambers in access and we put it into a floating robot that will move slowly by water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see plastic chunks floating through the sensor while the computer computer is that the computer computer process this image and measure the size of every particle, to get an appropriate estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
We document this step-by-step invention on a website for inventors called "Autonomously: with the hope that somebody else is even more.
The great thing in this project is that students saw a local problem, and public, they're trying to solve it immediately.
I can research my local problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well informed.
You see the news, they make the Internet, and they stumbled with this image.
A child, maybe under 10 years, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands, in Searing, the world's largest mangrove in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water they drink -- it's the water where they band, the water where they fish, the place where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown -- the mud and oil are also a brown color, and when it all mix up, it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called spectrograph, which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a spectrum that can bring up through all kinds of substances that produce different spectrum -- which can help identify what's in the water.
We took this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help remote to other children.
"I can investigate a problem with distance, and I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that they disappeared several giant waves called technologies, and those tsunami developed several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in an instant.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fublish, a nuclear central center near the water.
And today, according to the reports an average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has contamination traces for "Stanford."
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the Ragistor radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation came out of the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it's safe -- it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to Fublish every year from the accidents and research, independent with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring children.
Of course we didn't take them, parents didn't allow them.
But every night we report to the control center, here you see the use of different machines.
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously but they did it because they are going to have to live with radiation all their life.
Together with them, we discussed the data that day and we talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the interaction, etc.
And to do this, we create a remote traditional map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the elevation map, we introduced pigments to represent real-time data from radiation, and we rock water to simulate rain.
So with this, we could notice that the radioactive dust was filtering from the top of the mountain to the river system and desperate in the ocean.
It was an appropriate estimate.
But based on this we organize a civil expedition, the closest to nuclear central to date.
We came up to 1.5 miles from nuclear central, and with the help of the fish in the area we were collecting seminarians from the sea milk with a service of sediment as we invented and built.
Here's a progression: we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple technology.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the largest space of social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically you can build almost all there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of kids can become reality, and where adults can be children again.
Students: Alexander." Accellular."
Tail Harvard: We asked questions like, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or can we help the mobility of the advanced age population transforming their standard wheelchair in new electrical vehicles.
Plastic, oil and radiation are terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave to our kids are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the kids of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientific citizens, creators soldiers, we need to prepare the next generation to worry about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two twin cells, two radically opposite cultures.
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a single silk store.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is imposed on the environment, the other thing creates it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the brown memory, he saw a figure that fought for free.
The phone was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living beings are not confident.
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we have all the information required by every cell to work and to replicate it.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by the rage of manufacturing and production.
The mountain lines have dictated a world made from parts of them, including the imagination of designers and architects trained to think their objects as a discovery of discrete parts with different functions.
But you don't find manufacturing materials in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with diabetes diabeted.
The skin skin skins are more thick with little pores with little parts.
You act mainly as a filter, the other mostly as a bar, and yet, it's the same skin, there are no parts, no analysis.
It's a system that would gradually vary its functionality by variation of electricity.
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the divided world, the double personality of every designer and architecture to work today between the phone and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions in the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analytics and senses, is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, on its simplest level, is trying to bring these two visions in the world, moving away from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourself, "Why now?
Why was it not possible 10 or even five years ago?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they collect four discipline that offers designers to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four fields, my team and I created.
Please know your minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools and tools through scales of scale, like this robotic arm with a textile base that one day is not very far removed to print entire buildings and graphics to manipulate microbes made of genetically modified microbes that shine in the dark.
Here we have reinvent the cell -- an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where each openness is unique to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a skirt -- this was for a fashion fashion of Paris with Iran van Health -- it's like a second skin made from a single piece -- rigid in the controls, flexible around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator, we print this layer and missing 3D determines between the cells. I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and white materials on 20 microns resolution.
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a Chinese scanner.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the synthetic instruments, allowing us to design products that adapt not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, a chair at a time at a time, comfortable and also absorbed sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator, we went back to nature to inspire us, and when we design this irregular surface, it becomes synchrony.
We print this surface of 44 different properties that vary in rich, optimistic and color, correspond to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, vary its functionality not through the addition of another material or another business, but variations continuously and definitely material property.
But is it ideal nature.
There are no parts in nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Hebrew Bible, and one of them was left and came to me and come up with a lot of what I care about.
As she says, "In the third day of the creation, God sent the Earth to grow a fluttering tree of fruit."
For that first frugal tree, there would be no difference between transport, branches and leaves and fruits and fruits and fruits.
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land has grown trees with branches and cortex, workshops and flowers.
Earth created a world made from parts.
I often ask myself, "What would the design be if the objects were made from a single piece of piece?
Are we going to go back to a better state of creation?
So we looked for the biblical material, the kind of material of the fruit tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second most abundant biology on the planet is called the television, and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs, screens and butterflies and butterflies
We think that if we could synthesize their property, we could generate multi-marriage structures in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal marine.  We asked a lot of shrimp cars, we mix them and we produced punishment cake.
Vanging the chemical concentration, we've been able to achieve a broad range of properties from dark, hard and opaque to light, soft and transparent.
In order to print the structures at a large scale, a system was built with multiple burned extraction molecules.
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made out of a single material in a single material long, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, they let them dry to find a natural shape to the contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with plastic.
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain photographic microorganisms, which appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we set out the bacteria genetically to capture a quick carbon of the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without a glass of glass to block, and if you add even more, the window.
A fruit set of fruit.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for biodiversity designed objects to become biodegrade, put in the sea, will feed marine life, and put them on the ground, will help grow a tree.
The adjust for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We look for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for intellectual travel.
To do that, we need to dominate bacteria and control their flow.
So as the periodic board, we made our own table of elements -- new forms of life created complexity -- manufacturing manufacturing and biodegradable shaped.
I like to think of synthetic biology like liquid alcohol, only instead of taking accurate metals -- synthesize new biological functionality within very small channels.
This field is called microscope.
We print our own 3D channels to control the flow of these liquid bacterial crops.
In our first piece of clothes, they combined two microscopes.
The first is the cyber.
It lives in our oceans and the freshwater tank.
And the second one, E. color, the bacteria that inhabit the human intestine.
One converts light to sugar, the other sugar consumption and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microbes don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never met.
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think about it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the digital tract. That will help them flow these bacteria and they alter their path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, watching the properties of the material according to desire.
If we wanted more pictures, we designed more transparent channels.
This particular digestive system, when you stretch from one end to another, it would drop 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our deliberately disappointed.
And here it is, as primary at TED, our first paradox police, cancer liquid channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary Shermon said, "We are critical pastest creatures, only half the matter."
What if design would provide the other half.
What if we could create structures that increase living matter?
What if we could create personal microbes that would scan our skin, repair damaged tissue and sustain our bodies.
Think about this as a way of editing biology.
I call this material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D printer printed material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
Growth. Adam with software.
This worm of worm -- for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home inside of which he metabolides.
The dealing with this level of software.
It makes it through combination not two materials, but two proteins in different concentrations of concentrations.
One acts as a structure, the other one is the glue or the matrix, using those fibers with each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm is created in the environment, creates a tension structure, and then it starts to inflate a company of compression.
Tendency and compassion, the two forces of life, they manifest in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we pay a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to history.
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the silk worm of sea.
However, when we put the silk worm on a flat park, not within a box, we realized that he would smell a flat chapter and still metabolize sanitary.
So we started designing different environments -- different antibiotics, and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of chapter is transmitted directly by the environment.
They often boil silk worms to death within their chairs, their silk is disappeared and used in textile industry.
We saw that designing these plants we could shape the raw silk without boiling a single chapter.
They were manipulating each other, and we could create these things.
So we scale this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a hillphan robot doing silk plates, and we placed on our site.
We knew that silk silk worms toward darker and cold areas -- so we used a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or approaches, to block the rays of light and heat -- distributed silk silk salaries.
We were prepared to get the orders.
We asked 6,000 silk worms to an online silk farm.
And after we feed them four weeks, they were prepared to smell with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the airport, and as they harvested, they were coming off, they were strangely, they put eggs, and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
When I hear biological silk on the icy silk robotically, they give all of this pavilion their integrity in it.
And a little more than two or three weeks, 6,000 silk worms took 6,000 miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The pollens, after the choice, produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional pills in the future.
So here are the two visions in the world.
One ice silk is through one robotic arm, the other one fills empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give products to the products and the buildings around us, to form a two materials, designers must bring these two visions in the world.
Which brings us back to the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads us from design inspired in nature to an inspired nature in design, which demands from us, for the first time, that we make nature of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked you what you want to be from up?"
If you had to remember how old they had when they first asked them for the first time?
You can show them with the fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question "What do you want to be from up?"
They've caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be from up?"
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had too much.
In school I liked English, the mathematics and the art and developing website. In addition, he played the guitar in a public band called Telescope Frank.
Maybe you've heard about us.
And I generally like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy, and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this feeling of brilliant, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to me.
And I have to leave it.
But then I get interested in something else, which is completely different, and I get up in it, and I get bored and I feel "Yeah! I've found my month: and then again this point where I start to be bored up.
And finally, I want to leave it.
But then I would like to discover something new and different, and I would like to focus on that.
This pattern caused a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I was not sure how it was going to become a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, negotiating all of my other passions and refuse to meet me.
The other reason I was caused so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me because I don't define anything.
I was concerned to be afraid of commitment, or being willing, or being an administration or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something I'd like to have planned then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where they learned it, they learned it from culture.
You ask first of all, "What do you want to be from up?"
We have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares what you answer at that age.
You consider an naive question to provide cute answers in kids like, being astronomer, or "Britain or "I want to be a picture."
insert Hollywood discovery.
This question is made over and over again as we grow in different ways, and I went to high school students ask you to choose at university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be from up?"
It goes from being the line of the bird before we take the dream off.
Why?
While this question inspired children to dream with what they might be, it doesn't inspire to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though you have good transported adults maybe laugh and say, "Oh, what a nice, but you can't be an artisan of violence and psychology.
You have to choose."
This is Dr. Bob Chiles -- and he is an artisan of violent and psychological.
And this Amy Nuga, which is an editor of magazine converted in illustration, business, teacher and creative director.
But most children don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life focused on our culture.
It's this idea of the fate or the true voice, the idea that each of us has something to do for their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But what if you're somebody who's not connected in this way?
What happens if there are many different issues that wake up their curiosity and a lot of different things that they want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And I feel like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a multiplicity.
A crowd is somebody with many interest and creative activities.
It's a mountain for this.
It could help if you divide into three parts: multiple and potential and day.
You can also use other terms that drive the same idea, as a surgeon, religion.
During the Renaissance, the ideal was who was well dressed in multiple disciplines.
Barack Sherry refers to us as scanners."
Use any term you like or invent your own.
It seems like a kind of advanced to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the crowd as a limitation or affluation that you need to be seen.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths to be in this way.
Here are three multinational supers.
One: ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and creation of something new in intersection.
Sri Hanny and Rachel Binai expressed their shared interests in cartoonist, data, travel, mathematics and design, when I founded Muslim.
Muslim is a company that creates geometry insulined geometrical.
And Shake and Rachel came up with this unique idea for its mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens in interactions.
From there they process new ideas.
And the multinational ones, with all their ancestry, can access a lot of these points of interaction.
The second multinational superpower is fast learning.
When the crowds are interested by something, we're going to that.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are inhabited to be principles, for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to test new things and get out of our comfort areas.
Many skills are transferred to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area that we pursue -- so we rarely start in zero.
North Dong is a full-time journey and independent writer.
As a child painting perfect an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known mechanism.
Before I became a writer, North was financial planning.
He had to learn the most final sales of sales when he started their practices and this ability to help him write compelling launches for publishers to write the statements.
It rarely is a waste of time to do what you are going to attracted to, even if you end it down.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have anticipated.
The third multinational superpower is adaptation. I mean, the ability to transform into anything you need in a given situation.
Abed Coah is sometimes director of videos, other people, websites, sometimes consultant a Kickstarter, sometimes teachers, and sometimes it looks like James Bond.
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take any different roles depending on the needs of their clients.
Fair magazine defined adaptation as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and unpredictable that they are the individuals and organizations that can public to satisfy the market needs, the ones that will actually thrive.
Senses of ideas, quickly learning and adaptability and adaptation," three skills where the crowds are very handled, and three skills that could be lost if they're ready to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a big interest in forcing the crowds to be themselves.
We have complex problems, multiplication right now, and we need no conventional thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
They came out of the belly knowing that they wanted to be pediatric neuroscientist.
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong in you either.
In fact, some of the best teams come from a special and a multiple employees.
The specialists can dive deep and put in practice ideas, and multiply offers a volume of knowledge to project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are crowd-and-a-half how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the crowds largely are encouraged to be more like their specialized partners.
Once said that, if there's one thing you take out of this talk, I hope that's this: recognize with the internal cord, whatever it is.
If you're a heart specialist, then especially for all media.
That's where you will give the best of you.
But for the crowds in the room, including those who have just figured out to be one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, recognize with their many passions.
They follow their curiosity for those block markets.
They explore the interactions.
And embracing our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, multiplexible, the world needs us."
Thank you.
In 1991, a woman named Austrian took it to a psychiatric in France.
Audience was destroyed and couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called Alaska.
Alec didn't know how to help Australia, but she was flying for her until unfortunately he passed in 1996.
After her death, Alec did an automobile and found strange plates and silent plates in the Australia brain, a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If Australia would have been alive today, we couldn't give it to her more help than Alice gave him 114 years ago.
Allen was Dr. Alashmen Alzheimer's Dr.
And Justin Department, the first patient in getting a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since 1991 medicine has advanced a lot.
Anthropologists have been discovered and vaccines to protect us from infection, many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral for HIV, stations for heart and much more.
But gradually it has been progress in the Alzheimer's treatment.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find an Alzheimer's cure for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But in 2050, it will affect 150 million who, by the way, including many of you.
If you wait to live until the age of 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's ability to be almost one in two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that they spend their sleeping years with Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or dear with Alzheimer's care.
In the United States alone, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical assistance is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
It's the most expensive disease today, and their costs provide a five times in the year 2050, as the generation of the baby bathroom.
I may surprise you, but Alzheimer's one of the largest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively done to fight it.
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that can't be prevented, cure or even rational developing.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research that in Alzheimer's research despite the fact that the Alzheimer's access and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what a few people know, but everybody should be, the Alzheimer's one disease, and we can cure it.
For most of the last 1400 years, all of us, even scientists, confused Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it will be sensitive in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there is only to look at a picture of a healthy brain in comparison to a Alzheimer's patient to see real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to discovering a severe loss of memory and mental skills, damage to brain caused significantly reduces life expectancy and is always mortality.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found strangers and strange bonds in the Australia brain, a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds like an origami.
There are places in the paper that are pedestrian.
And when it gets well, these sticky dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky dots stay on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules in each other, forming groups that can form large plates and birthday.
That's what we see in patients with Alzheimer's brain.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this dysfunction works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of what happens to block is complex, like developing a bomb.
Cut a cable could do anything.
The other can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that blocked it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of them have reduced the cables and waited the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, genetics, chemists and engineers and mathematics.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when we tested these drugs in the worms.
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, they have protein molecules that paste each other inside of them, like in humans with Alzheimer's humans.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms on a early stage, then we see they healthy and live a normal life.
This is just a positive startup result, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After 114 years of hope, there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope to get the Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to focus that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we try it, we can see it.
In the case of other diseases, patients and families have gotten more research and exert pressure about governments, pharmaceutical industries, about scientists and legislations.
That was essential to advance HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit today to sell cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, hidden victims, circumstances of their loved ones and night, are often too disappeared to go out and advocate for change.
So, really depends on you.
Alzheimer's not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like Australia, who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They help talking for them, and they help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article at the New York Times Modern Mountain in January of this year.
To fall out of someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience by testing myself a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are taken to make 36 more and more personal questions and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number 12, if you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would it be?"
Number 2: When was the last time you cry to someone else?
And alone?
As you move forward, these are more and more personal.
Number 3: This really likes me. Tell your partner what you get away from him or it -- I know very sincere this time, and I gave things you wouldn't say to somebody who you have ever known.
When I stumbled on this study a few years ago, a detail really called me the attention, the spark that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all the lab to the ceremony.
So it was skeptical about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also intrigued as well.
And when I had the chance to test this study, with somebody who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to get to me.
However, we fell in, and I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the Love Modern column a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's an August -- so I guess some of you probably ask yourself, follow still together?
And the reason I think that this is because I've been asked this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the paper was published, I was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been able to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entry can come to a few hundred of view as a lot, and those were usually only of my friends in Facebook and imagine that my article in the New York Times would be probably about thousands of views.
And that made a good attention burden in a relatively new relationship.
But as he was like, I had no idea.
The article posted on line a Friday night, and already the Saturday, this happened in my blog traffic.
And the Sunday had already called me the Share Show and the Google Moralry America.
In a month, the article received over eight million vision, and I was, for saying something, little for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with very loving experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of a has been international news, and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call or write, what they did every day for weeks, they did first the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search on my email with the phrase, "Do you still follow together?
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers like this.
They interviewed me in the radio, and they asked him.
And even I gave a talk, and one woman shouting up to the stage, "Hey Mandela where your night is?
And I immediately put red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable to ask about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the research of the answer.
The 36 questions seem to have made their own life.
In fact, the New York Times published a complex article for San Valley, who included the experiences of the readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
First of all, my first impulse was to be very reserved with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that both of us will do a public emergence together.
He took television interviews, and he took the pictures of pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid that I was afraid of becoming the innocent icon of the entire entire entire prototype process -- a range that I didn't feel at the absolute grades.
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked, they wanted to know whether it really worked, I mean, if I was able to produce perfect love, not just an adventure, but love love, permanent love.
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt about everything that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if we keep together or not, and also do it decrease?
If the answer was no, would I do the experience of doing these 36 less interesting questions?
Dr. Arthur Aron wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997, and there, the research goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I sought to foster interpersonal approach between college students, using what Aron called Super-controlled Personal openness, progressive and recovery.
Sounds romantic sounds romantic, right?
But the study does work.
The participants felt closer after doing it -- various present studies were also used by Protection Rimit of Arab as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between the members of the police and the community, and they've used it between people of opposite political ideology.
The original version of history, which tried last summer, who combine personal questions with four minutes of visual contact -- was quoted in this article but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a small university of liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me to tell me, "I tried the study and didn't work.
He seemed disappeared for it.
And I said, "Do you mean that the person who did that you did it?
Well, he made a pause here.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, "But did you become better friends?
Did you feel that you could know better after testing the studio.
The season.
So it works, I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled on the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation.
I had had that relationship since I was 20, which was pretty much my whole life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or she could live without it.
So I flew in science.
I spent everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I hoped that that could sort of get me to empty the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I just research for the book that I wrote, but in retrospect, it seems really obvious.
I thought that if I was armed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and alone as I felt then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more relaxed.
I have more confidence to demand what I look for.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably I can tell me.
What I look for love is a guarantee -- not just being loved today and being loved tomorrow, but to continue to be threatened by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if they were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to fall in.
There may be a way to sort of mitigate something of the implicit risk, and this is a very attractive story, because they will make us feel wonderful, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of history asking me, still follow together?
And his content with an answer of Yes or not.
So more than a question, I would propose we ask more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who you deserve your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things get complicated, and how to know when to cut and distract?
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably delivers a relationship, or even more, how do you live with doubt doubt?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more reflective conversation about what to love someone on.
So, if you want the brief version of my relationship, this is this -- a year ago, a year ago, a meeting and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, and we fell in, still followed together, and I'm very happy.
But fall in love is not the same thing as staying love.
Looking at the easy part.
So at the end of my writer, I wrote, Love didn't happen.
We stayed in love because we take the choice to be.
And I'm a little bit of fun when I read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I had not considered everything that comes up with that choice.
Not to consider how many times we would have both of them to make that decision, and the times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing if he will always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and answer 36 questions, have chosen to love somebody as generous and nice and fun and expressed that choice in the largest day in America.
But what I've done, instead, is to convert my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really think true.
And what I look for, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the final happy implicit in the title of my article which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I really didn't write.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he will also love me, and it's terrifying -- but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lines in a mountain full and in a certain way, and I kind of came up with a forest blood.
In New York City, a time ago.  Something that really affected me but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box, and I found a dollar bill and a pull and a fork on it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange humanoid or aliens would find this box about 500 years later and learn how our species exchange ideas, for example how we eat spaces.
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has because I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At one point I was at Hawaii, I like to go from excuse and make surfing and all those weird things, and I was doing a colleague for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took up all the pages and I made a kind of collective cells to the style Agnes Martin, and I covered them in resin, and a bee was stuck out.
Well, my mother is afraid of bees, and it's allergic to them, so I add more resistance in the canvas, thinking it could hide it.
Instead, the opposite happened: somehow it seemed like increased size, as if you look at the text with a magnifying line.
So what did I do? I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs strange bottles I was finding on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to relate to them and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow the traces, draw the same thing that is done around a cave in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and created my own tax of spectacular spectacular.
First, bottoms, that you can make an idea.
Then I did some insects and strange creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the reserve layers.
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to School.
It was strangely, man.
At some point I am interested in the human shape, natural size resistance sculptures with human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I died.
I no longer knew what to do, because the resistance was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing in the glass layers, similar to the drawing in a window, then in another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed three-dimensional composition.
And this really worked, and I could stop using the resin, so I could stop using it.
So I did this for years, and my work lung with something very big, that I call a testimony."
For the testimony I was inspired by the "Dead of History Boston Definisions -- which is a painting at the Protest Museum in Spain.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of their time.
Well, the tracking." I'll explain this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
500 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and the landscapes.
There is a cave where all these creatures with animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation to this analogy of analog mesh where they hide.
This is where the animals with animals are headed to the father, ready to survive in mass by crawling in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised from thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to an administration.
Bill Graham is in the sea -- the Homolia -- the oil platform of the dead. Wall, the Higgs Bin Laden. There are all kinds of weird things you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
But also a kind of machine.
It's coming out of the ocean, and I choose oil in a hand while the other hand is coming up clouds.
Their hands are like whales and it looks like a mythological being that keeps Earth and cosmos in balance.
So it's an aspect of the traditional."
It's a little bit of a narrative.
That's the hand I write.
And then when you go on the other side, you have a trade, like a bit of bird, and you spit clouds from this tradition.
It also has a tail of 5,000 feet long, a line of snake that unites the testimony."
Anyway, their tail is preparing fire in a volcano.
I don't know why I happened.
Things that happen, you know.
His tail ended up in a balloon of collective calculation made out of terrorist cards.
Have you seen them?
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very ahead of their time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two projects, one called "Picks?
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material are emotionally, dictionaries.
But each one acts like a kind of architecture in a way of being human, and travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at a time.
They're like cells, they together, they divide up.
And you can walk between them. It's getting me years.
Each one is basically a microscope bit that weighs 1,300 pounds with a human trained inside its inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the head -- it's the chest. It's the chest. You can turn the input in.
Let me take you through the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and that it covers the penis or no nose, or whatever it is, a kind of anger thing.
It's a quick reflection of these work, because I can't explain it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body party by half.
This is two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are a few pills coming out and go into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the hybrid quality.
Can you see it?
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called Pink World.
In this box there is a physicist -- a neuroscientist, a painter, a music, a writer, a writer, a record, a radio emission, a museum, a school, an editorial arm that drives all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
We measure the box and all the people in the inside collide with each other as particles.
And I think that's how we change the world.
When you redefine who is and the box he's living in.
And together we get to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, from borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start sharing those things with humor and genetically we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
Take a supermarket.
But for this pill to have the pain effect on pain, first goes through the stomach, the insects and other organs.
To take a pill is the most effective system and informing it so that whatever drug is actually effective in the body.
The disaster, however, is that when you put it any drug out of it.
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take antiretroviral drugs, they serve to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase CO2 cells.
But they are also known by their adverse side effects, mostly negative, because in the time they go to the blood stream, they distant, and worse even for the time they go to their destiny, which is more importantly, in the HIV warehouse.
These are regions of the body like little lymph nodes -- the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is intact, and it doesn't easily enter the blood horizon of the patients that join the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new blood cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that are an additional life treatment by the ocean.
One day, I sat down and I thought, "Can we get the treatment directly to the deposit of the virus, without the risk of diagnosis of medicines?
As a scientific expert, the answer was in front of me, the lasers of course.
If you use it in baseball, for the care of wounds and diabetes, you can use it for anything you can imagine, including the extracellular transportation of medicine.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, which open and close almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
And you say, "How is that possible?
We sent a little laser and powerful beam laser on the cell membrane infected by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of microscopes.
Before I even notice, the hole is immediately represented by the hole.
We're testing this in vitro technology or in Petri plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply to the human body.
"How is that possible? You can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a three-dimensional device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we will make an incidence on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is headed to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, an injection that distributes the drug, releases it directly in the infection site, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't look a lot about time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to total exhilaration of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all HIV research in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying non-viewers not statistically, arms organizations like terrorists, instruments or military military.
I document what these groups do when they're not shooting out.
My goal is to understand better than these general agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition of violent participation to nonviolent confrontation, not violent.
I'm doing field work, in the world of politics and the library world.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-governmental actors.
For example, from the 25-year-old peace agreement between 1975 and 2011, 1960 were signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these groups, we should even engage them or defeat them in any successful conflict of successful conflict.
But how do we do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons they fight, how they do it, but nobody analyzed what they do when they don't fight.
The armed struggle and policies are related.
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less defeat them, without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the Liberian Health Labeless known for its violent cooling against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, Henzan has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Hall palm known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also admired the Gaza of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
They're multiplicity.
They set up a complex machine of community, radio stations, TV channels, Internet websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the ISIS magazine, printed in English and published to recruit it.
The armed groups also invest in a complex reduction of funds without savings, but through reasonable businesses, for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
And armed groups also make something else: create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they manage hospitals, they have to get professional formation programs or microbes.
Hello offers all of these services and more.
And armed groups are also trying to conquer the population offering something that the state not benefits: security and protection.
The ascent of Taliban in an Afghanistan desperate by war or even the beginning of the ISE ascent of ISA, can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an incredibly elevated price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a vacuum, a gap left by the government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election of 2006 of the Palestinian Homo cannot understand without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at the armed groups, we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or vision in the long term.
These groups are heartbreak.
They grow because they fill the gaps left by the government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups, participate in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated things are these organizations, the less we can categorize them as something contrary to a state.
How do we call a group like Health?
They dominate the territory part of a territory -- they manage all of their functions -- pick up the garbage -- manage the sewer system.
Is it a state. Is it a rebellious group?
Or maybe another thing, something new and different.
So what is ISER?
The lines were destroyed.
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hurricanes, and the more weak the states are, like in the Middle East, the more intervene and fill that gap.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in not military tools.
To fill that gap of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and comfort peace.
If we understand the armed groups, we understand better what incentive to offer to foster the transition of violence to nonviolent violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, military power can win some battle, but will not give us peace or stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safety vacuum to fill that vacuum of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are vehicles, but I fear that accepting the phenomenon tag would be unfair for the feminists.
I'm a feminist but quite bad.
And therefore I became a bad feminist for me.
Or at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The bad Feminist, and then in interviews, people started calling me the Feminist Family.
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a deliberate projection, has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the females, these furry women, angry with the men and hate sex -- as if that was something bad.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that people were using when they insisted that could be female.
Being labeled as a feminist was an accumulation, a taboo and dramatic word.
I was labeled as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which asked too much, with high self-esteem.
Nobody wants to be that reef woman, until he realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, feminist and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are interestingly, women are equal to men.
We deserve the same rise for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as we want to, free or violence.
We have right to use it easy and accessible the contraceptives and the reproductive services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for legislative control or educational doctors.
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about women's needs, you have to take into account our other identity.
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and sexuality condition, social condition, skills and much more.
We have to take into account these differences and how they affect us, the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of inclusion -- our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are evidence, but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There are lots of things that make a bad feminist of me.
I have another conference.
When I drive the work, I listen to rap music random points.
Although the letter is degraded to women, and I was deeply offended by the classic "Salu Shakespeare," of the Hong Bang Twin is amazing.
Make it reality to your monkey t-shirt training.
Portray, harm, move until you hurt the coach."
Think about it.
Portray poetry, right?
I'm completely motivated by my musical taste.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, including --  all domestic tasks -- but also killing insects, the record of garbage and the care of the machine and the machinery maintenance and the machinery maintenance and the manufacturing maintenance and the manufacturing maintenance and the mosquito maintenance of the market.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
I enjoy the fashion magazine and the beautiful things.
I can see "The Baghard and the romantic commerces, and I have absurd fantasies of the stories of makers that make it happen.
Some of my details are more desperate.
If a woman wants to adopt his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to judge it.
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise his children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem isn't that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is confident so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they choose it.
We solve this problem.
He rejected the conventional feminism that has ignored or desperate historically the needs of the color women, the workers and humanitarian and transplant, for white women, hospitals, middle-class women.
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist here.
It also happens the following: as a feminist I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put destructed feminist in a pedestrian.
We hope that they go to perfection.
When we get rid of them, we would take them very much from the same pedal where we put them.
As I said, I'm a disaster -- I think I'm a destruction of that pedestrian before they try to put me there.
Too much women, particularly innovators and sector, are afraid of being tagged as feminists.
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a feature for fear of what that tag means, for fear of fear not to be able to fulfill with the little really realistic expectations.
Let's take Berkeley, or like I call it, La God.
In the last few years, it's a declarated feminist in the last few years.
In the Vikina Music Arabic video of 2014, at MTV -- I act in front of the word "female word from three feet high.
It was a magnificent show, to see this pop star to embrace the feminist and make women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
So past the time, cultural critics started debate if Bernshell was or not exactly feminist.
They calculated their feminism instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and marine.
We demand perfection from the feminists, because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much a lot.
We're going to go far beyond the criticism and constructive criticism to break up the feminist of any woman, to break it up until there's nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism -- or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of participation.
But what happens next?
We moved to recognize our impacts to realize stories, move to action and be a little bit more brave.
If I hear degradation music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy to provide an unlimited supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until we choose change affecting their profit.
It is hard.
Why is his music that will be so pedestria?
It's hard to choose something better and easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my niece, three and four years.
These are two magnificent girls, decided and brilliant and also very brave.
Where they are appreciated by the strong creatures they are.
I think of them, suddenly, the best option is used as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treated against the sex violence against women as sports -- is going to look at the Trees God.
We can change radio emissions when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema somewhere else when movies are not treating women more than decodent objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates as a bag of box.
In any case, men, especially white men, the managers can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your revenue, or to work with you, until it doesn't include enough of women, so much to participate how to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your advertising, or your organization is more inclusive with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are survived, but invited to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also deny to be included until more as we are welcome to overcome the barriers to the decision positions.
Since we are not people -- without these efforts, without adopting these positions, our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions come to the top, people in the direct power and printer power and music producers and music, CEOs, the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create lasting and meaningful change.
We can also claim our feminism -- well, bad, or any note.
The last line of my book "Baby Feynman, he says, "Professor will be a bad feminist to not be at all."
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say that, especially because I announced my voice was stolen and the feminism helped me to pick it up.
There was an incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids were given to me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I stole my voice, and after everything I didn't dare to believe I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And it came back to me.
It reminds me in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who look like me and understand what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and female, I also discovered that if it was a little valuable, another woman could hear and see that none of us is the world trying to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to do anything.
And in the other, I hold the humble reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist -- I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve the way I think and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when you need such a value.
Right after Christmas last year, 133 children in California had a measles to have visited Disney or to be exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, infected over 100 children in Carricon.
One of the tragic things about this outbreak is that the measles that can be fatal for a child with a developing immune system, is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the children involved at the Disney outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be even worse, the autism.
But a moment, was it not the article that stopped the politics on autism and vaccines and devoted and marked by being a fragmenter deliberate by the British Medical Johnson?
Doesn't most intelligent scientists that the theory that vaccines cause autism is a statistical?
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still afraid that vaccines are going to make their children danger to their own autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in the autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered very rare disease.
The few psychologists that I had heard about her create a whole professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, prevalence estimates followed stable just three or four children per 10,000 children.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started shooting up.
The fundraising organizations like Australia Spaceships are referred to routine autism as an epidemic as if it could be contributed to another child in Disney.
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
So if you ask people at the Centers of Disease Control of The Atlanta Disease of Falling what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases as a disconcerty of animal diagnostic and a better case detection to explain these growing figures.
But that kind of language does not take a lot of the fears of a young mother who was looking for the face of his two years, the visual contact of visual contact.
If diagnostic criteria had to be amazed, why were they so reduced at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the 1990s?
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less to do with the slow and key progress of science that with the seductive power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact in the global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in dark corners of clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with an infant psychiatrist, Leo Kansas, in 1943, Kanza published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to be able to inhabit private worlds -- feeding people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours waving their hands before their faces, but they were pressure of the panic by menus as when they didn't put their favorite toys in their usual place without knowing them.
Over the base of patients treated in their clinic, Hannah speculated that autism is very rare.
By the 1950s, as a world authority of the world in the subject, declared that I'd seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome while collecting references of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not extracting, because the Cartoonisting criteria for autism diagnosis were very restrictive.
For example, it was disabled to give kids with conversations, but now we know that the epidemic is very common in autism.
Once he was rejected that he had turned to nine in every 10 children sent by other doctors to their office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
Kanza was an intelligent man, but part of his theories were not accurate.
It classified autism as a form of child psychologists caused by cold and disabled parents.
These kids, he said, have been carefully maintained in a refrigerator.
At the same time, though, Hannah noticed that some of their patients had special skills that are surprised in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 symphonies, before the two years.
When her mother put one of her favorite discussions, he correctly said, "Google her."
But Kanza had a bad opinion of these skills, to claim things like the kids were just regurgitating what they had heard of their parents, desperate by winning their approval to win.
As a result, autism became source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible for the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, that researchers began to test Kansas theory that autism was weird.
Luther Window, cognitive psychologist in London, thought that Kansa Monder theory was quite stupid.
She and his husband John were warm and affectionate people, and they had a deep autistic daughter called Super.
Larry and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like Sweden without special services, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
In order to defend the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, Lord and their colleague Judith Google decided to do something that should have been done 30 years before.
They did a research study of autism in the general population.
They took a London suburb called Cambridge to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that Kanzi model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, whereas others were rooted in their fascination for astronauts or dinosaurs or the general of reality.
In the other way, these kids didn't fit in beautiful squares and standard, as Juddische, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the monolithic model of Kanzi would have predicted it.
At first, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How did no one have been perceived from these kids before?
But then Lord found a reference to an article published in German in 1994, the year next to Kanzi article, and then he forgot under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
Kanza knew about this article of competition, but he avoided essentially to mention it in his own work.
There was no even a translation to the English, but luckily, the husband of London spoke German, and he translated it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans Asia, who runs an integrated clinic with an integrated school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's teaching children with learning differences were even progressive for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic, they started with exercise classes with music, and children follow their games on the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asking the described as a political disability of life that required compassionate support for support and adapted spaces in the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asking them to call them their little teachers, and they dedicated to help the educational method development that they were especially suitable for them.
Fundamentally, Asian saw autism as a diverse continuum that was running a surprising variety of doses and disabilities.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in architects known to pop culture like the awkward social scientist and the teacher distributed.
He was beyond even saying that for success in science and art, a piece of autism is essential.
Larry and Judy found that Kanzi was wrong as autism was infectious, so that the parents were the causes.
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American American Association to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called autism "spectrum?
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes came in virus, by holding the limited model of Kanzi by a wide and inclusive Assiance.
These changes didn't fall on a broken straight.
Case, when Lorraine and Juddisch worked between baseball to reform these criteria, people around the world saw an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out of "Aristotle Man: only a little circle, I knew what the autism was, but after the innovation of Dustin Hopkins as Ramana Babbage and the Research Manager recognition with four members of the Academy -- pedestrians, psychologists, teachers and fathers around the world knew what autism was.
At the same time, the first easy clinical trials were used to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of Rain Man: changes in the criteria and the introduction of these trials created a network effect, a perfect storm of autism awareness.
The number of diagnostics started to rise, like they predicted Larry and Juddish, actually hoped that it was, getting people with autism and their families finally get the support and the services they deserve.
So Andrew Walder came to blame the vaccines for the increase in the diagnosis. A simple, and seductive story as bad as Kansa theory as the authority theory was infectious.
If the estimate is that one in 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic is one of the largest minority groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined on the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are to solve for the new medical advances by the way the neuroscience is going to celebrate the variety of human cognition.
One way to understand neuroscience is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's broken.
According to autistic standards, the normal human brain is easily distribution, obviously social, and it suffers from a deficit deficit to detail.
Without doubt, autistic people have difficulty to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching Asking, who believed that the cure for the most exciting aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employees with capacity, support communities, and support parents in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named Zummer Karls once said, "We need all the hands in covered to understand the barrier of humanity.
As we navigate towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that face as society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
