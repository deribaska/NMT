You know that what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, most of you read in America.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you today about circles and <unk>
And you know a <unk> usually is something that fell into you.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in the middle school, where I was the weird <unk>
When I went to bleed to bleed every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom <unk>
He made it <unk>
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and he ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults never come to know us.
You could trust Ohio, and please bring that man to that man and you have found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to ask you, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and it took care of her family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult arrived at <unk> became a <unk> and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, it had become a circle -- and that <unk> that I talked to you was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of your life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs to love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to tell that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> it around the water almost 60 meters -- and I couldn't more than thought that it was a <unk> on a <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
The <unk> are born when you fall from the glaciers or you break the barriers of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to <unk> and hold up to the end, while others can't afford them more and become a <unk> of passionate passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated and together, as much as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As you melts a <unk> I'm breathing its atmosphere <unk>
As a iceberg is melts it releases fresh water in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, so knowing that in these unique moments there are in that way, and it will not exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the <unk> ice that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years old.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's kind of frequent to get really to witness a <unk> iceberg in it.
Here it is.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg in average size.
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two partners in 1979, the same day, every single <unk> a baby. Okay.
So two partners every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of yeah, you're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the <unk> and the sperm is joined by the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X X chromosome joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both of them, and it starts life.
We'll go back to them later.
On my activity I can get two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the history of anatomy.
I am a <unk> of training, and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- which is, of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body body, the idea of <unk> what have you thought about about the body.
The other role that in my job is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people who are much lower than average.
And I've worked with a lot of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical <unk> doesn't fit into the male <unk> and conventional <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many ways.
I'm going to put some examples of some ways to have a sex that didn't be <unk> in the common forms or female ways.
For example, there's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene on the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in life life that became <unk>
And then, in life <unk> the testes make testosterone.
But because this individual <unk> of testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high testosterone levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops in a course typically <unk>
When you <unk> the baby has a little bit of a child.
It's a little bit of a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breast and it doesn't have the menstrual cycle, when someone realizes that something is going on.
And after testing you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has a <unk> and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think this is a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, as men, we have the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone hormone.
Most women like me -- I think a <unk> woman doesn't know its <unk> structure, I think it will be a typical woman most of women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to <unk> than the woman who was born with testicles that have the <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way, can be everywhere.
Another example ago, a few years ago, I got a call from a <unk> boy born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, I was wearing a life as a boy and I had just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
It had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosomes and the uterus the <unk> glands were so active that they essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, its genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born <unk> <unk> no one <unk>
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people have develop what is known as <unk> which is to say, they have tissue <unk> wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know how that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- they are <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> <unk> surgery -- it's not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that it comes to several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy comes to <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity, <unk> to be black in African anatomy in the historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that is to have children that are born like two people in a same body.
The most peak case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called them to wonder: "What a exam are going to do to determine whether <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists who don't have a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, more we have to admit that these categories -- we were thinking about these categories -- stable categories that are <unk> directly into <unk> categories that are much more <unk> than they are <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> in just a few <unk>
And as we put together in science, we get more and more in a very awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our own culture, in the United States today, are the struggles to the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- it's not in public, but in the basis of <unk> about when someone is considered killed.
Our ancestors have never had to <unk> with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of them would put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved not to <unk>
If you stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract light organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma of really determining somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this categories of categories could be diagnosed with someone like me.
In politics of politics, I'm liberal, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
I think these categories are much more fragile than we thought we were thinking.
It <unk> from the concept point of view.
And to tell you about this tension -- I have to admit that I'm a <unk> fan, <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical and so radical in what they did, that I find that every little watching that music, <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> -- for me, the first activists in the anatomy and I explained why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and they <unk> it with another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our parents <unk> was the idea of the <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs from the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the birth of the birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that they could come to the political power by the right of the blood right from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
<unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it by a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they're part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it comes out of course, if you look at the history of the parents, <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the explanations -- and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> being passed away from a vague idea of the birth of the birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And a consequence of us were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people in the <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement and saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people of color that we <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we have to start asking ourselves why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give the same rights to a human.
I don't mean that we should be <unk> by anatomy.
I don't mean that at the age of five years should be allowed to have sexual relationships or getting married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me they have sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things in the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary. I was born three months before of time, June 1 1980.
Henry, in the contrary, born in term, was born March March <unk>
For the fact that we had been born three months before Mary is attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the sex -- sexual consent, the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that, not because it has a different biological age, but because he was born.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered man -- if I didn't tell you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man who is now <unk> <unk> <unk> of which Mary has to worry about.
Mary. I don't have the same rights to the marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry one woman in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved both in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point that we have to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a certain point has decided to marry a man don't have to have chromosome and to marry to marry a woman you have to have Y.
Now, in practice, they don't make tests from people to <unk>
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you to the beginning of the <unk> syndrome.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I love a solution.
He says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks very good."
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do people judge <unk> <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this for <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> that they probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the <unk> that I know can make more intelligent <unk> intelligent and <unk> about their sex relationships than I know.
So how do we put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And one part of me asks what if the character of a person could in the future will be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to continue this current business of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless they are willing to drink a change of sex, in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that I had made <unk> <unk> <unk> to then pick up their fame.
But when the phone asked her the reason for the operation -- he was a very <unk> operation -- he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum.
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who they are <unk> to change for the sake of state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to conclude, I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we were given greater involvement to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a label, and it is that I think there can be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about them.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and dealing with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in college, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in <unk> <unk> I thought I was <unk> as a <unk> He made me a <unk>
<unk> What has the female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to be able to get rid of the <unk> the gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about his question, the more I thought there is some female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to the complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very attentive to find the way to protect people from the state, it is possible that that having been able to have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk> of <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we bring democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a <unk> <unk> let's think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where it wants to go live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, at this point, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't tell with one city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could easily address the world -- perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But I just would take up to apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartment in apartment already -- and to the other half of them still stop to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you think about is that those buildings and the areas around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the <unk>
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, build a whole new apartment building -- always new, and when the rules of that place would build the construction instead of putting it up.
So I suggested that governments would grow new food zones to contain cities, and I gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of <unk>
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people will come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, I went through a constitutional crisis.
In the next presidential election, <unk> <unk> was <unk> with a platform in which <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> to be his boss of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say that you can't go and annoy all the current residents from apartments.
We spend a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes both technologies to be able to <unk> and usually they're the rules that keep us keep going.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They name me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than its cost of <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York <unk> which in some cases, worth thousands per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk was describing in very simple terms that a <unk> city is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option so that people can choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I called, and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five <unk>
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport is covering over 100 kilometers.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about about 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The faces of the public were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have it here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained how <unk> a new city can provide new choices for people.
There would be an option in a city that you could go to that could be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries, could benefit from the countries that are associated with helping them establish and make the norms of the <unk> so that they could all trust that the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and we saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could be just a thousand square miles.
And shortly later, the 19th of January, voted in Congress to <unk> the Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement to allow to create these special regions of development.
In a country that I had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the ballot company in favor of this constitutional constitutional media was <unk>
All of the parties, all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the Constitution -- you have to pass two times in Congress.
On February 17 has been approved again in another voting <unk> to one.
And immediately after the polling stations, of 21 in February, a <unk> for about 30 <unk> was at two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is being built in Korea in Korea, is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years old, getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about it <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow managers to <unk> and then it would allow it to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow her Supreme Court to be the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban <unk> and cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know has already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies who wanted to spend on the <unk> especially in a place with a free zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change it immediately.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents that have to leave behind their family to go to a job, sometimes they're mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even children who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to think about insist on the families to choose between several cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank you <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and it's that I live obsessed with the <unk>
I love to find, <unk> and more recently, I photograph and publish on my blog and colorful and different things for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets, and <unk> <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet people <unk> usually my money goes to a good <unk> My way is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It's going to be my size?
I want color to you.
cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I mean.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear and nothing else.
It <unk> inside the exact exactly one week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that I would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because you don't know me as the woman who walks for TED <unk> --  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons in life that, believe it or not, I've learned on this journey of not using new life.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All of the whole, including <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be bad, when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, not just <unk> you are also <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the kid who are wearing a inside.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the <unk> or I remind them of their little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't see yourself well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, there are no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth, six words for you: The <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week just by what I was doing, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, and Brooklyn, I'm going to donate it all.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave behind certain things.
I don't need to be <unk> emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there's always going to be another crazy and <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I came back.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic side, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> from every <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be somebody that's totally intuitive.
So, where's your brain at this scale?
Some of them are <unk> by one of these ends, but I think for most the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We set up to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you can have developed over the years is the one that says that one thing can be only in one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember watching a boy playing on a parking bar.
It was a little boy and he didn't do it very well, they always <unk>
But I bet you play with that <unk> and I bet you actually taught him a valuable lesson, and it is that big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with the parking phone, they play with these little particles.
And when you play with your particles, you discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like you can go through walls, or you can go through two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics.
And at that point, the physics was a few years ago -- you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because they don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit my logical piece of logic.
Because if it's all made out of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it should not happen to follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it didn't have been.
And so I would feel so much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that it's been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to make it a little bit. It's found right in the center.
And then we do a very big approach to the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little little bit of metal, a form of springboard and that stands up on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> <unk> <unk> which is found underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum <unk> but for it needs some help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of odd things, but then when other people go up to leave you to do those things, because I don't want them to, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> <unk> <unk> are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We put out the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled all the air down, and then we <unk> it at a temperature of less than a degree above zero percent.
Now, by being just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free of acting as he wants.
So we measured their movements.
We found that it moved in very weird forms.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way it was <unk> was like a breath in this form -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And when we give it a soft, we were able to make it <unk> and that we don't <unk> at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing, and we don't <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up for up and down.
It's just at particular <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time, they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, notice this, the difference on the scale between one single atom and that little little bit of metal is roughly the same than the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why not as well?
I mean, it's my piece that I talk about.
So imagine if they were in various places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you use your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we <unk> it and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw that metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just going to be <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics says that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that, it's deeper.
It is that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally, define who you are. And that's the profound strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and took me.
And so many of the negotiations and stories will be done with 17 <unk> very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just on this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> out of a great education, not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, began to learn a lot.
And working at Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show the demo to you then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from your launch.
So, let me go to <unk>
Look around all of the museums that there are.
There's the gallery <unk> at MoMA, <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move out there and it <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one click, we jumped in.
You're inside, you want to go at the end of the hall, right?
Don't go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information about <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 billion pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What about 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really do with 10,000 million pixels.
It can zoom around in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are going on.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this looks like <unk>
I walked in, and I discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And I spoke a little bit, I talked to some people in the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is on hitting a <unk> with a <unk> Tuesday
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get it even deeper and see that you can actually get into the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull out the image, so you can actually see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump up at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk> <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It increases and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk>
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things over here, but I don't have a time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that's the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked inside, and I've created this function that I call "The Power of the <unk> -- we just made a zoom in around.
It's <unk> <unk> at the National Gallery.
You can write things out, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all incredible things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium to do justice to their work of art, and it's represented online online.
And the big question that I'm doing today is, you have done this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian <unk> all the kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that something really interesting has happened in the racing racing racing one in the last two decades.
It was already some time ago, if you wanted to win a childhood career, one, take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what in engineering, you know, real-time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that real-time control systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming open computers.
And as <unk> are starting to respond in a different way, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex on the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the weekends at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms that are going to be <unk> and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says he took the hammer and he threw it out, in Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- which is not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection <unk>
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of the summer of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup there.
Maybe some of the remember, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end of it, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, eventually won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity in the Web.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The timeline is at the top.
So late late afternoon, there are people here and there doing <unk> <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> France.
<unk> people do a quick call to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, yes!
That night everyone went to <unk> the center.
You see the big summit.
And then the next day they all went to the center of the <unk> team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> people will <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have done a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and we consume.
Today, we know all about the <unk> of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, How do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, like you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a label on the trash and then we start <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that had not existed.
They're happening things that are complicated things and there's no need.
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we just just <unk> is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that if the plastic bottle we dropped a day still is still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and lots of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all began with a question of the mayor of the city that came and told us that Spain and south Europe has a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can the technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> tubes from <unk> <unk> and they open up and <unk>
It was believed as a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you go down the pixels you can write in them, showing patterns, images, texts.
And as you zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can go into the image.
We presented this to the mayor of <unk>
It liked a lot of it.
And then we <unk> an commission to design the building <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There are no windows and windows, but when you get there, it opens up so you can go through.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all architecture disappears as in this case.
Those days there will always be someone in the winter, when they go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, not you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture away.
Here it is working.
You see people <unk> by what happens inside.
And here I'm just trying not to <unk> the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was really even more fun.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was going to open to you going on, but a building that was still doing <unk> and water holes and you had to jump out there not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because like architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the pixels of it, the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air, and every single one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, that moves with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud, to form.
So a flexible screen like this with a normal screen in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is the light, not the pixel position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can get closer and <unk> and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> as it has before.
When the lights are done, it looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with a entry that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best ballet dancers today, the star of the New York City and the <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use them as input to the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so <unk> in real time as a movement capture.
It can be <unk> all the movement.
You can walk all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine that we could engage people to do something and change our environment as a <unk> environment like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make all of them a little bit like a <unk>
And I think that the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can go through the digital world -- we can go through the digital world, the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That means something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or the emissions of CO2. How do we move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but it's covered by pixels.
You can move around inside, having different experiences.
It can be seen from the bottom to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better about what are <unk>
Suppose I would tell you that, with just a lot of changes in your genes, you could improve the <unk> by a more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, to be stronger -- having more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and <unk>
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe they're from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What do you most <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people do you understand creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably got to the number of creative creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you want <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, the majority. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe is that possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> issue here at the TED Conference, but today I want to give you a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay titled "Nothing in biology makes sense of the light of the <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution, consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Do you mean others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end is, of course, the one that interests you.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here a few <unk> years.
It might seem like that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, <unk> <unk> that comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all take in the most bacteria that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> tells you about the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that they can want to have no effort on their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of the <unk> <unk> towards the way.
But therefore, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients -- and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something probably better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is as a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I was just <unk> I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental -- most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms -- each cell simply <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters on the <unk>
But when <unk> organisms appear to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body of the body comes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student thinking, well, <unk> <unk> deaths by <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in his 90s, years.
And one night someone hits his door in a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a magnificent dancer of clothes.
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
<unk> says George, "I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of the <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to healthy <unk>
I wanted to restore health in the disease.
I wanted them to live more and more healthy.
Evolution consists of passing the genome to the next <unk> adapt and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send genetic payload to the next level of <unk> and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that <unk> Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily apply to longevity.
It wouldn't necessarily apply to the biggest or the hardest or faster and even the smarter.
Evolution favors the best creatures in their environment.
That's the only trial for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean, the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there was fish there -- fish <unk> fish in empty -- yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to think about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase, I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've had a kind of balance.
And the <unk> reasoning would be that through medicine, we first have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation that we have to happen to happen.
A second possibility is that you produce an evolution of the natural traditional kind of traditional kind of traditional form dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution can slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when as a species, the distant planets are going to have the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there are a third possibility, a very sexy possibility and intriguing and frightening.
I call that <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and <unk> by us as individuals in the decisions that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality of a lot of people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society but is what you choose to individual and family level.
Think of it as well as possible to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in their own body to make the genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic change to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You don't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of change is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project began 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year we had finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost close to 20,000 and a week.
Not a lot of fun for us to actually make the human genome for <unk> and getting more and closer to each other.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that aren't just going to protect us but are going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in course with the flu <unk> in cells from a plant plant plant.
Can you imagine a good thing that comes out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is becoming more and more possible.
Imagine the other two little <unk>
They can change cells in their bodies, but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give your children a better chance of a healthier life, to remove the diabetes, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease is going to allow us to also take a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't we live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to turn the evolution of prior to <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can <unk> to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices for a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to selectively selectively that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for bad, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. It was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only thing I could talk to with the flight <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly, that is not the road.
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three <unk> words have ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I didn't, and I didn't, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences I wanted to have and never <unk>
While I thought about that, I came up with a phrase, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it up.
I don't want to give you anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the bridge George Washington who was not a lot -- I thought I was about, Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've been trying to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also to give my ego.
And I'm sorry that I think about things that doesn't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have the reason -- <unk> will be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, <unk> die isn't fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids growing up.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> like a small child.
And for me, that was all the reason for the world.
At that point, I understood those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For most of all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, I didn't die that day.
And I was assigned to a gift that it was the ability to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge that you can imagine that the same thing is happening on your plane -- and please not be that -- but you can imagine, how do you <unk>
What is it that you <unk> you're still expecting to do because you think they're going to live <unk>
How would your relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're being the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with lots of projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
One day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has a total paralysis, in it.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation design company, so obviously, graffiti is something intricate we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to <unk> it to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and it will be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that you have seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate by those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you are a good person and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Anybody to see the film "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, and they're making fun with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented to the single desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I <unk> with his brother and her father there at that very very moment, "All right, "All right, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much inside your inner cannot be able to <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research <unk> Research -- who have a technology that allows them to project light on any surface and then with a laser pointer that's about that and register the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
You start with sexual organs, after the bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and at the end, people start to make art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so the journey began.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and too much to move things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we touch the doors of insurance companies and we get a machine to make it <unk> I could play a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because by talking to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "I don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all the <unk> world from every single corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, and we moved to the garage, and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something totally stupid and when they <unk> would have taken out the walls of the walls and the walls would be <unk>
But for two weeks, I <unk> we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They're a couple of <unk> <unk> which we buy in the <unk> of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> things and <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it together on a LED light, and there's a device that is free -- and that's a <unk> we published the code <unk> the software is going down for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance insurance company.
There's no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we came back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture, because this is the next room of another person, and that's her room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of science games all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and he's looking through the support system of his life.
I <unk> the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot from the hospital.
And he came back and draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to shift in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and I would take me out of there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
And in a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion, motion.
And we have a long way to go with this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to go and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
<unk> were <unk> "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends of closing the <unk> is that in April this year in the <unk> of the <unk> in the middle of Los Angeles will have an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> in urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: If you look at something that is not possible -- do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- <unk> the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at some point.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something and <unk> me with wonderful people in order to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want us all to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel that we have to do.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in <unk> in very difficult situations and at the same time so dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days eating just this -- fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in a little bit horrible appearance with the only goal to try to look at social issues in ways that we are attractive, <unk> interesting, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that would be helpful and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that was coming up here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little differently.
So some of you may have heard that or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took an <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it into ridicule to you or your company to do it.
But said that, it's a very good opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would not have been allowed for sure.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we examined the world of the marketing, of pitch.
And as I said before, I've gotten myself in a terrible situation in the last few years, but nothing could come to me, nothing could be <unk> for something that difficult or as dangerous as to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that I tried to do a bunch of products, the marketing and the advertising, and that the whole film was <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest <unk> movie.
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all of the top at the end, it has <unk> <unk> all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> Is it <unk> Is it <unk> Is it <unk> A <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk>
He was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the brand of the brand of the brand of the brand but we're going to make sure that we were burning all the categories that we could on the film.
Maybe you get a shoe and becomes the most cool shoe you've ever met.
The most great car that you've ever driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink than <unk> <unk> of "The largest movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show the brands as part of life, make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the complete idea, all of film, from beginning to end.
And I would love to be able to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how to get people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you're very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- how much money does it need to do this?
MS: One and a half and a half million -- very <unk> -- John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out of us as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is the response?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> for the film or to be I?
JK:
MS: That means you're not really optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. That is the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where he will go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation out of microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make that as many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and stage in the separate media, is not the idea to tell with that new vehicle that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, that my idea was a <unk> error and that error was this.
Actually, no, there was no such error.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>    -- this is one of the first pictures that are <unk>
I like the way in <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free or <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility or access from information, especially in the practices of <unk> being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the <unk> even the CEOs are <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to reality, something changes quite suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk> --  -- like that weird bear that is still still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to the companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want them to be <unk> history.
We want them to give us a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was sitting in a lie -- and there he was looking at me, as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every single story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I met John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go on my own, I would have to take the <unk> and go to the companies with my whole team.
So what I started to <unk> suddenly -- and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking to the business the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make a big, huge, huge, giants and others that make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood Hollywood movies say the reason why their films are so successful is because of the brands they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest <unk>
How are we going to see <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "Are you good good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you to help you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there would offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like for <unk> solid <unk> in bar, like it.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller films that we <unk> are more <unk>
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, remind you of people is the reason that we're interested in.
MS: What words would you use to describe to <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Volunteer: Technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you can get in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold and cool.
I think it's a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you <unk>
How do we keep ourselves fresh longer?
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common type.
I need to talk to the man in the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> Something like <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, so many gray colors and things like that.
Usually I carry <unk> like sunglasses, or I like the <unk> and the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand that could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand that I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: At the time part of the <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of the pet guy.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because they <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be <unk> but I often <unk> myself at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could get into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> of <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped people like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If you could do it for them, you could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first photo is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world that you think about, like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and start in a place and in my case where they come from and start in my family, West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I wanted to be me.
I like the different things.
I like weird things, I like things like that.
A: Tell me about <unk> to what is that?
What's the <unk> What phase is <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little more about you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to be afraid.
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: Thank you for your patience. Big <unk> A: yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to get out of this.
There was a lot of crazy things around this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of the <unk> the brand Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only <unk> in one of their strong points or in the other rather than focus on both.
A lot of companies tend to be -- and it's nature to avoid the things that they're not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements are actually <unk> and you make them become a positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can see here also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful brands and brands all these things that have gone and come up with it, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to get your identity of brand, your personality <unk> what would that be?
Are you a <unk> <unk> You're somebody who makes your blood <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are as playful as being playful as the <unk> contemporary and bold and bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical as <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
You're <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
You're a traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, <unk> safe, sacred, or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they would not have control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film of how they now use MRI to identify the centers of desire in the brain as well for commercial marketing and for films.
We went to San Paulo where we were banned from charged air.
In the entire city for the last five years there is no <unk> there is no <unk> there is nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting into schools in schools with money problems in America.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects I have had the biggest answer or the ones that I've had more successful are those where I have interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> to the <unk> took out of their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to do to think of people, who will challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? Did it succeed?
Well, since the movie was taken off in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was taken off in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions of the media for this film.
This covers just a two and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no television.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to make <unk>
And it's not bad, because almost all the agencies that we talk about to their customers is not going to be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get people out of that is pushing them to failure.
I think when you train their employees on loss aversion is preparing their whole company for <unk> of rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people to not fear the opportunities they can <unk>
Ultimately, move forward, I think we need to give the fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Now more than a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk, <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So I <unk> in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check to the TED TED organization, the Foundation, which is a <unk> Foundation, to be applied to my assistance for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> computer is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are real-time control systems.
If we managed to engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software is a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray box -- then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
<unk> enters the gray box <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started research on <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely <unk>
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk> using multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
That really struck us the attention, and we started an experiment in which our environment was <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they had very weird things.
<unk> <unk> as a lab rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but he didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it's actually working on that place.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, let's say, for example, a power plant in the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the target soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs a small and a big one.
We also saw that were armed armed armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
They will <unk> all the dots to attack.
They probably even know how much to <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very much above all we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures, and we tried to <unk> them with the real world with potential targets of the real world.
We need theories about jobs that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about targets, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it's got to be a <unk> <unk> and it's almost likely to be located in Iran, because it's where most infection has been <unk>
They are not several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and to the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I met them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find on code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that cell phone inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in a obvious effort to go crazy to the nest engineers so that they could not solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> stands up on that code, can't be <unk>
I started to investigate scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what is called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
So it wasn't like it wasn't like this.
The results have been sent after several weeks of hard work.
They were <unk> they were <unk> and we had to go back and forth.
And yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> would tell one and the same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making these <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> is communicating with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very trusted that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry about other goals to be <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw, I really <unk>
There's the gray box and the top, you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the <unk> values for example, of sensors for example, and the vibration sensors and provides code, which is still running during the attack, with false <unk> data.
And believe it or not, this false entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds on <unk>
<unk> <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need human security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbines goes down, you have to open tubes in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then they can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> or the security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a power plant, or a car plant.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this burden on a <unk> <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You can also use conventional technology of worms.
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what you <unk> is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and we need to be able to prepare right now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can carry on and give you a <unk> abilities or another thing to do that users of lawn chairs get up and go back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something you put in the morning, gives you a big force that you can also increase your speed, and help you, for example, how to drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other <unk> <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on by talking about the American soldier who, on average, you have to carry on your back a <unk> load of <unk> and you are <unk> to take more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help to handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can <unk> 90 kilos for variables for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So back now the look at the users of wheelchair users, so I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in the wheels of <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often very young people, with damage damage that when they start their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide up a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that are getting <unk> quickly.
Their only option, many times -- for a brain injury, or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from his successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who does 19 years ago had an injury in the spinal column, and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, until now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> to <unk>
It has a few sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> on the crutches that send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
There are also a few batteries that give the motors to the motors in the <unk> and in the knees, and they make it progress with this very natural <unk>
I was 24 years at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, skiing the bottom cost <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost every feeling and all the movement of <unk> down.
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole down to the last little hint of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs up rocks in <unk> climbing rocks and even riding the <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that was allowed to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change future future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of chairs from wheels to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Foundation or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, we know about their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of the rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimps, their closest living parents.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary ancestor, which lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this way in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by big <unk> <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant of society where violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest <unk> and it's been very hard to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an soil of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario in a violent conflict that has been sustained for decades and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction is also <unk> the survival of the Bonobo.
The hunt for hunt and deforestation do that you can't fill a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laughter hidden in the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to drive conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game of children.
For us and for them, the game is fundamental to establish ties and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo sees the roots of the <unk> the dance and the human ritual <unk>
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what he is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common both in bonobos like humans.
And this video is really interesting because we play this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and at the same time it's more fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female, who is playing with a little bit of <unk>
I think, like her, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that propels us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we have to adapt to a world more and more difficult to greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
In order to adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But let's get to the most of the <unk> capacity.
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
To bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks like the least appropriate thing to play, they can be the moments that it is the most <unk>
So every fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as you <unk> creativity, your friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for the development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of the captain of a <unk>
And in our city, where the volunteers are faced with a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of it.
But there was still a race to foot against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what was our homework.
When I met the <unk> he was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly passed one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  He came first to the captain and he asked him to go and would save the dog <unk>
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a burning building to save a live living only because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go home.
I need to be <unk> <unk> and bring it to this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but I was able to put up the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the firemen at the end of the hall, I went to the firemen at the <unk> that at that height of the fire and I walked into the main room looking for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my back off the staircase and I met my <unk> and the gorgeous dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house, the treasures for the owner of the house where, like, their treasure. got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department was a letter from the owner of the owner of the house <unk> by the brave effort to save her house.
The kindness that she looked at on the other was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling such volunteer -- I'm witness acts of acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of <unk> and courage and courage to level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or are we to get -- remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: I don't hold this.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you <unk>
<unk> food in a dining room, a <unk> park.
They're mentors.
Not every day, we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So you go back to the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, you come back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem odd, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first blocks of concrete are built in <unk> with a very simple idea: <unk> modules from a fixed measure that fits each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or the buildings or a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
He was called brick from <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to every home.
It's been estimated that have been made more than 400 billion or 75 bricks for each person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or buildings.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete, <unk> in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, at the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of aesthetic <unk> piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete, the transistor allows you to create much larger and more complex circuits a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
About eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of taking the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about all of it is they come together by magnets.
So you can't get in a wrong way.
The bricks have a colors.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink is the entrance and the orange one is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue piece of blue with a green and very quickly you can start making older circuits.
A blue one with a green produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we changed the button by a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We <unk> this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make it faster or further slow, simply this button is a button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to <unk> bricks and ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given <unk> to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand electronics in every day that we don't learn in schools.
For example, how a light from night, or why the door of an elevator is an open <unk> or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience in electronics they start to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, who don't have an experience of an engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, an <unk> cannon turned through motion.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of us all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can go on the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is going to be involved with the <unk>
collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to get the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I was the time for time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> <unk>
We put some members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of submit to the Third World <unk> in the wild world <unk>
They made big <unk> they worked with their employees <unk>
Your job is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would look for a quote, but what you really look for is that somebody else has caught up by snow because he knows it's not very good at <unk> <unk> when it's covered with a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for help to do this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that point, very much last year.
They realized that the city was never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, he developed an app.
It's a nice application that you can take on a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
And when you put it, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a piece of <unk>
It's a modest app.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 applications -- the last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads <unk>
One responsible for the city of <unk> <unk> to see this app that he could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people <unk> the batteries.
So he asks citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we could use to use it.
And this has spread out without <unk> and organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen anymore.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool so that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then we told us that that the normal channels would have taken it at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there is a project in the court of California that all the time has the cost of two billion dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that is program in a couple of days and it spreads in a viral way, is a kind of <unk> shot from the government <unk>
It suggests the best ways to work, not as in private companies, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in an open form and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way of addressing the government of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of a <unk> institution but as a collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to engage together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country who contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They're not given up with the government.
They feel a lot of frustration to that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us crazy, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics doesn't <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately <unk> -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way it thought about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of Internet care and information <unk>
It's the place that serves the calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
<unk> <unk> on official knowledge.
I didn't find anything that started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put it very strong music and see if you <unk>
And it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
You didn't want that application.
It was the work of very clever people in the Office of New York City <unk> in Boston.
One day, this really happened is this <unk> <unk> in my trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I approached the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of the income of government to collaboration, distributed cooperation.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another one, but the government had a key role.
connected two people.
And it could have connected to the government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people get it, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input system is a vote.
How many times have you chosen to a political <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy in order to choose a new political leader and then we hope that government <unk> our values and <unk> our needs, but then we don't see any changes.
That's because the government is like a immense ocean and politics is the <unk> surface <unk>
As we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> that holds us from that is that we funded as something that we funded in our against, that one thing, and a result, we are losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real government work.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report in 325 pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And so for those of us who have been <unk> to the government, it's time to ask ourselves what world we want to leave to our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we are going to be able to go without solving the institution that can act <unk>
We can't do <unk> we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to root the root function of government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> we just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I, I am a greater generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving it almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face on who is going to <unk> they're all going to speak.
You can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and do it.
So when you face the government problem, you don't really care a lot about your voices.
They're using your hands.
They get the work to program applications that make better work better.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> pulling out <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that; we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody here when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or we'll be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in developing communities and places where there is a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing about these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are being said here has impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that would not have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
Here we have seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good, <unk> if it's <unk> it can make a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the law, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the entire family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
She was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but he was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good <unk>
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and I said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I would go back again and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that would always wish to be close to her.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of the 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with it, it was not easy to capture his time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I woke up when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room, and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first, I thought it was a game.
So I looked at him, and she was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, I walked across the room, and he took me out of his hand and he said, "Come on. We both are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
It took me outside, and he said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I'm <unk> I didn't <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and she looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I will never forget it.
And then he said, "Just do I want me to ask three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is you want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
Like I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
And then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to ask you, is that you will always do the right thing but the right thing you do is it.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to do is that I want you to never be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in southern rural. I have a brother a year and a older sister.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and I went to the forest.
We are just doing the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and was offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing as we do.
I already took something, your sister is also <unk> a <unk>
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel like you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's up? Take a <unk>
I landed with the strength of the strength and said, "Oh, not that you're thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I will tell you something that you should probably say.
I know this is being spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a <unk> I'm saying it by the power that has identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that really don't make sense of it.
We can't get to do things that do not be able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My parents died from diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to her, we should <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so much despair for these facts.
One of three black <unk> between 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> around the country, <unk> Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Washington, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in the color are in jail or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system, which is a lot better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is what the results <unk>
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The fear politics and anger makes us believe that these are not a problem of ours.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work on some very curious.
In my state in Alabama, as well as other states, would you give you the rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it over the next 10 years the level of the loss of rights will be as high as it was before they <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where they were sentence for 13-year-old children to die in prison.
We have this country prison for children, no chance to get out before.
Now we are in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in some sense have been <unk> to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way of how we're in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes -- but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by error.
In every nine <unk> people have identified an innocent that is <unk> and released from the death row.
A <unk> error, you know, an innocent for every nine.
This is interesting.
And in aviation it would never be able to fly airplanes if in every nine than <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on <unk> history, I talk to you about slavery.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until World War II.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a time defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
Now there are people older who are coming to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you dictates <unk> <unk> <unk> to the people who stop saying that in our own history of terror, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with <unk> and decades of <unk> racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning that we've historically done.
All of the time we get to each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about <unk> I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death row.
It was fascinating, because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's very disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> no death row in Germany.
<unk> can never be this here."
The room was silent and a lady who said, "There's no way to our history, we can never get to get to the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> we would put us up.
<unk> about this.
How would we feel that in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult issues, the positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology, creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate both things.
lately we talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that that means spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> which will never come to TED.
And thinking about it is, in a way, something that's inside of our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to intellectual <unk>
The development comes not just of brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas -- also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection from the mind to the heart is what drives us to look at not only in the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the difficult one.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in the East Europe, suffering from the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is practically at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, it must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allows us to be truly human, if we don't pay it attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, by injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, I called the lady <unk> I called me to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "Be lady. I do."
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I <unk> <unk>
So I went and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said, "Now, <unk> tell me that this idea of justice <unk> is.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving me my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech, and I just looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> got <unk> and he said, "This is why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to tackle those challenges, those issues, that suffering.
Because ultimately humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my job.
I've been a lot of a lot of fun in things.
I've come to understand and to believe that each one of us is superior to the worst we have ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie. It's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So this is why I think there's a basic dignity in people who should be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I actually think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> you don't judge by our technology, for our designs, nor by our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the <unk> the character of a society, not because of the way the rich and powerful things are treating the powerful and <unk> but way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> <unk> like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients of 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to somebody who is not <unk>
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night, I was awake at night, and my God, if the judge can become something that you are, you have to have <unk> powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has <unk> powers.
You should ask for something of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I was 14 years old, a little, black poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> so my <unk> <unk> is treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> executive from a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there that there were been <unk> behavior in <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical but a lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it, but he had sent him to court.
It took about two months, I had already forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to the court for this case, stupid.
I got to the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I was finally dropped out of the car. She walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
So I approached it and I <unk>
And I was <unk> on the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
By coming in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> <unk> And we started walking.
People started to go. Everyone was <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
The police <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, in the room was full of people. And everybody was talking about <unk> because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I went to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I looked through the window, and you'll get to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
And finally, this old black man walked into the room and sat down behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, <unk> judge a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> on the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black stood up, he looked at me, and he looked at me, and he said, <unk> this young room to tell this young woman who keeps his view on the goal with <unk>
I've come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds to justice.
We can't really be truly <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> by <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view on the goal of <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You will try to hear and see a evident of the audience, in this community, to help in your way, to do something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there's going to be a <unk> this spring in which is going to make an effort to do it -- the funds that are spent today in terms of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row, in the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of <unk> cases not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes do not come at all.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the rule of the law, to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
And part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the largest <unk> rate.
What would you say to the people who believe that is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war on Drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince ourselves by the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people out of the supply chain, to steal a bicycle, for small crimes against the property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've been excited about this today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> threats for Bin Laden's death.

Several <unk> War, <unk> mass destruction.

<unk> Death <unk>
Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to care.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of our senses our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And like nothing matters to us than survive, the first stop of all of this data is an ancient <unk> fragment called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the <unk> danger.
<unk> and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us damage.
So by a <unk> of <unk> stories, looking at the <unk>
That old saying <unk> "If there's blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices provide us negative news seven days a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be bad at worse.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the <unk> of species, water shortage, and we have no doubt we have.
As human beings are really good at <unk> the problems, and in the long run, we just have them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average average income income has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of electricity, transportation and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy passed from 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're actually living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people are doing it.
And we continue to <unk> faster and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., a lot of the people who live under the line of poverty have electricity, water, <unk> <unk> <unk> air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such a <unk>
So a lot of this is technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in the information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law and doubling the price of price for about 12 to 24 months.
So your mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- at good time and bad time, in war and peace, in recession, in <unk>
It's the speed of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop to any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster and faster.
And on this curve, <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
<unk> in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call computation computing, sensors and networks, the robotics, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute control of all over the planet, synthetic biology, the fuels and the food medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory at "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was spade.
I sought in the newspapers the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to opponents <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone on the phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can we use to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And each year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
We can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating plenty, <unk> it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each of the <unk> it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that's <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, <unk> is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the 1800s.
He's the guy on the left.
Let's go to dinner King of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with <unk> gold.
But King of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington Washington is aluminum.
You see, even though the aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as <unk>
It's tied to oxygen and <unk>
But then he came up with the <unk> and he made the aluminum something so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
It <unk> this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy shortage.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet that we are <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in one year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of America, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after it passed away.
<unk> a famous picture. How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk> point.
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent ice is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> their technology called <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small <unk>
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water from the day of any <unk> source water, <unk> water by less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just thought of a significant test from hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence in that way, Coca-Cola will implement it this globally in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation for this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in cell phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications communications in Kenya that the president Reagan 25 years ago.
And from having a smart phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than the Clinton President 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications and communications that no one could have happened.
Now better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> video, <unk> video libraries and music, diagnostic technology, now <unk> and lost market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best part of it is when you have the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Foundation, which is something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the equipment in the world to get these technologies into a mobile device that they speak, and because it has <unk> they can get blood from the finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there is no doctors, where the <unk> load is 25 percent of the health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus like RNA or DNA <unk> to call health care, and first of all, stop the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just got the brand of seven billion <unk>
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we'll go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds were never before <unk> that add up to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What a <unk> What a <unk> <unk>
And instead of economic collapse. We will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> more health because of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D impressions and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion more members of humanity, healthy <unk> and <unk>
What about a few voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and we can act for the first time?
What about these 3,000 <unk>
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X <unk> is that small teams guided by their passion with a clear goal, they can do things that were <unk> things that could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up with sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> shapes structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
Have you played with this professors, university professors, each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined up and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is a better <unk> protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power today to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion for the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are <unk> to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few decades of extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I'll give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It was really caught up until the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, on the Galapagos and other places, so that does not have anything special.
But the case is, we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets still saying they keep <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a water in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned very much with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The water's surrounded by the water's surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from a <unk>
There were <unk> out of about 20 feet, the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so it was made more than half in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
<unk> to the 5 <unk>
You want a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing has changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970, <unk> started in <unk> Europe was done many development projects.
The fishing development was imposing on the countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this very bad boat, I called <unk> 4.
I went out to fish on him, and we did studies in the south of the South China Sea <unk> and, above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we capture was a <unk> thing.
<unk> now I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny little blobs about the remains of a coral <unk>
In summary, the sea bottom came to the cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then it starts fishing fishing.
The bottom is going to be a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Don't <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
He was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect the fishermen every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But there was no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember.
We <unk> the point of starting to a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have things, biodiversity, <unk> <unk> of the country, the water supply of the country.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the images to the beginning of their conscious life as normal and light it forward.
The difference is that they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the source of changes.
And at the end of the end to keep some <unk>
And that, in big measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that they are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant before <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this isn't perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a control of great fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time, there are few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we take this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them would like as a captain as a captain such as a captain and just watched a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or generally not use the scientists of the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
Hence the enormous paper that can be turned out a protected marine area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we really visualize the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has been <unk> and it's extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a marine marine area and can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Middle East, for example?
I think that the arts and the film may perhaps fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay simulation.
There were a long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people are being touched by the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do you <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is that I do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube video.
It's true.
So today we will see why the videos are <unk> and what matters has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today, the video video makes any of us, or our actions, copper environments in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can get famous on the Internet in a <unk>
There are over 48 hours of video for YouTube per minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of those, gets a myriad of views and makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and a surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this shot outside of his home in the National Park.
In 2010, this was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views of the popularity of last summer.
<unk> did not tell you a viral video.
I just wanted to share a <unk> <unk>
That's what you do if you call it <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this <unk> <unk> to the <unk>
<unk> trends like Jimmy <unk> gives us new things and interesting things to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  This Friday, a Friday. You have to start on a Friday.  You all want you to get the end of a week, the weekend.   <unk> on a Friday.   <unk> a Friday.
<unk> Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph is often showing the prevalence of use.
Like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nowhere.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask by those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science Foundation was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of creators is taking a view of view and they share it with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts talking about it and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment unlike the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
That's that, that's it.
This year, you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there is a three hours that has been seen four million times.
So even cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats watching the video.
But the point here is the creativity I woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version of the old one.
And then it became international law.
Suddenly, it came up with a whole community of <unk> that made this happen from being a silly joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Black Rebecca or Black <unk>
What script could have been written to be that <unk> this situation?"
In a world where you go up two days of video per minute, just that really unique and unexpected things can be solved by the way that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy that protest against <unk> in New York, I admit I wasn't too interested in it.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by not <unk> but there are often obstacles that prevent you circular from the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and your humor, Casey <unk> got five million people to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all the new things we do in creative form.
And all of this leads us to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities, creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- of a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said earlier, one of the <unk> Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't raise permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a bit of owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the current means of today's media, but we <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much time friends, now <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died of the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat <unk> <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girl.
For her, life had developed a task to <unk> the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges fiction, a boat out of the <unk> <unk>
All adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear were the pirate violation and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with a <unk>
If we were, we would first take it to my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are out of that boat, the constant rate of the motor -- the <unk> <unk> on every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the pirates who came several times, but they got <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the motor dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil shelf in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, I will end the journey was too <unk> and the first apple that I tried, because of the men on the platform.
No apple had then the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> whose population is <unk>
Unlike the middle class in the middle class -- whose existence I was in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double <unk>
And yet, I found time to study English and get a degree at IT <unk> of <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, no matter what should be <unk> which was generally <unk> was always <unk>
Two base pairs for school, one to hide holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were rare and <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, we're where?
One thing is <unk>
He was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother's home.
My mother had <unk> every boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares.
She opened up a computer store, and then he studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the mad trained, <unk> and <unk> children trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the <unk> classical student with what I <unk> of myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in life <unk> tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them were given aid over the years.
And because of that work, when I was studying my last year of advocacy, I was elected by the <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of the puzzle don't <unk>
As long as a resident anonymously in <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk about sites I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence she had ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we put up the ship.
He had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, and you won't be what you don't know.
So he talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I talked about, the more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were doing, living on the <unk>
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a career of <unk>
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's going to be an unknown, a newly <unk> in the scene -- and not just it's fine, but it's something that you will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside of my happy place to know that, yes, the world was <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that would not be <unk> were <unk> tremendously.
There was an energy there, an optimism <unk> a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
I went to a small group of people who the motto cannot be <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of each day, he made a giant pot of soup that all of us <unk>
It <unk> until the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant ones, and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure.
And before end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life didn't change for centuries.
Her father died after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, she caused a <unk> to <unk> and to take the cause she has himself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't have proved it to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the fourth of a hotel in Sydney when she was a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
He asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
Because you've taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through the women.
Since that we were and how life built us together now we can see that the men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would be very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that for yeah?
But I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a fearless one in every wave, the constant rate of the engine, the vast horizon that you won't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and see it to a certain piece of it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is now in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplane now.
At that time when I was <unk> the great Indian warrior -- Indian <unk> <unk> <unk> and with a <unk> and with a <unk> on the ground, he would find water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that makes me very much.
Every time I felt a little bit more than <unk>
I was <unk> this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't touch my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic, to be <unk>
My grandfather gave me to give me his <unk> <unk>
And this kind of technology of 50 years was for my <unk>
It became a golden door to a world full of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling of the mobile clocks -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I dropped this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
I <unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
How do we take the book.
Where we are, where we are.
Put the text with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what is that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back with a character from the book.
In several times I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through the GPS -- which is led to me.
My inner girl gets excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean wizards and dragons, but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that we <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a bottle were always exciting to me.
So here we have to tilt the iPad to release firefly fireflies.
And actually, they light out your way in the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
Every fantasy has always been maps but have been <unk>
This is a map that grows, <unk> and drive you through the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect for me is to create an Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
That's why we're bringing them back into a <unk> child story.
In a story that involves current issues as the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> glued to their <unk> they have not come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can get our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason children don't do it.
So to regain this childhood ritual we have to go out and in a chapter, they would take a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In other chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
And so you create a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A picture of London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
And within the different variants of connection between magic, the Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we had to have an interaction in which you go out with the iPad and the video on and through augmented reality sees a group of animated <unk> that appear on the inner plants.
On a moment the screen is filled with leaves here.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We are going to a world where nature forces <unk> with technology and magic and technology comes to each other.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We are getting closer to our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that magic, joy and child's love that we felt through a simple story.
Thank you.
So I'd like to talk to you about why many <unk> projects.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we let patients.
And one of the things we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she lifted a little cup of coffee or you and I asked patients, family and <unk> What <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or perhaps not all of the <unk> projects, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail since we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi <unk>
It has a doorknob and closed <unk>
Every morning I <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I set up the challenge of getting to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem is, not at the same time when he needs to be <unk> or some urgency to that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect my Wi-Fi scale and before I go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's the pressure of the pairs to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
So from next week being available from next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people <unk> from their homes, taking their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor and share it with others, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to regain the control and be <unk> from their own <unk> but it can also help us health care, because of the challenges that we face as the firing of the costs of attention to their attention and other issues.
It <unk> techniques that are very simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share with you with a video of you.
We all have <unk> <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> <unk> are <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food <unk>
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public to the public -- you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, when it's open, they already open up in the middle and the other you're closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we did an application for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> you can use your iPhone, and you can use your cellular <unk> to find your cellular <unk> to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just as a <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to make it globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at the universities, to help us find and work and act like a center for the <unk> of the <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
They could be <unk> or people of <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> who is shown is still in their place.
Please focus on this and not only improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest for photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera was in the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you <unk>
For me, photography had more than to do with being on the right place at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that started to press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a construction on a very <unk> street.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it holds a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful time with the common goal to keep the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to be captured in some way as a photograph.
<unk> that you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more than to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it real <unk>
It's the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What makes the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we took different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here's three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way can create something that still looks like <unk> as if I existed.
But, at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic as I think are those ones that they don't even <unk> the things around us in our daily lives.
But when we combine photographs is very important to <unk> because otherwise something is going wrong.
So I would like to say there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the <unk> photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> were taken at the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is completely composed of photographs of different places.
In the personal of the personal I think it's easier to create a place that we would find because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that has in your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew that I had several months to try and find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are out of a different location.
The <unk> part was captured by a pump of stone.
And yes, I even made it red at the top of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So in order to get a realistic outcome, I think we need planning.
You always start with an idea.
Then we have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and at the very realistic <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide on technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram I took from a folder <unk>
I'm not so interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other people we usually see, is a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude at the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk> is something new.
Here's something strange.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing on paper.
Why <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The answer is that if you draw it into a normal curve, where, let's say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I want to look at something ridiculous.
It would be something like that.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you were going to say, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very <unk> we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transport is as fast as we had <unk> we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go back to that rhythm.
There's no precedent in the history of technological development of <unk> growth that every few orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these <unk> curves -- we see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or it's okay to become a typical <unk> I know how to come up with something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
If we were like this, we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what the world used to be in a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask me is, what is that new way that you embrace the world?
So why new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has declined year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
And we can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today makes no sense.
So I want to talk to you about how that transition might be, how could that transition <unk>
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand this is taking away and looking at things in the long term.
The scale of time I would like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So you go back a couple of two billion years when the Earth was a great <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals coming around them.
If we look at the way that we organized those chemicals we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and it is that, at that point, there were some <unk> of oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside it.
Some of those oil droplets had a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring materials out of the outside and the droplets grew growing up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms those <unk> oil.
But those droplets were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe in chemicals.
And every time you <unk> it would be a distribution of the chemicals that we <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, drops that in some way will be better at the time to bring chemical <unk> to bring the chemicals out, they <unk> more chemicals and get more <unk>
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, and it was very simple, but things are interesting to be interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
So somehow we don't understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, we <unk> in this <unk> evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The incredible thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
So here I have 100 <unk> of dust that I try to hide the American security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data into this piece of DNA and it <unk> 10 to the 22 times.
So if someone wants to 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread it in the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years.
But then there was another big step in which things were <unk> very different and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information and to communicate information like that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, <unk> antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way they avoid penicillin and they were <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that they would become communities that they were together in it, and they were together in it, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or if a community was very successful all of the individuals in that community, they became more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities were so excited that they actually came together and decided to write all the recipe in the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism together.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell isn't serving without the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting than cell phone, which we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These began to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that did not do more than process information in community.
It's <unk> structures.
The neurons are the gadgets that process the information that those building cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So a organism could, for example, learn to not eat a certain fruit because he knew evil and got sick last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that before they had built these information processing structures that evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit together.
So the fact that the nervous system built these structure of information really accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a really complicated idea, a <unk> idea in the head.
I'm sitting here sitting emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your heads that saved a certain analogy of mine.
But we take something very complicated we made it sound in sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to work as a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we've started to make <unk>
We now go through periods as similar to organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> computer tape, <unk> tape, and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> in which it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told you was led to a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years old.
The next one, the language, and they took less than a million years.
And the next one, like the electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds its own pace of change.
The more changes, the more quickly does it.
And I think that's what we're looking at in this <unk>
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without recent scientists.
But now design objects of such complexity would be impossible for me to <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, and we put it into the machine and the machine with that does something that I couldn't do before, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
So we put into the machine an evolutionary process that runs on the scale of microseconds.
And for example, at the most extreme cases, we can evolve a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please make a hundred million sequences of <unk> <unk>
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, to run all those programs, and take those things to be <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to try and put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are most about tidying up numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences.
But one, fortunately, it was able to find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that you better did the <unk>
Let's take those and get them to the rest.
And now <unk> the best <unk> the numbers.
And then let's go back to <unk> following an analog <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> kids, which <unk> <unk> and the children will <unk> the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please, repeat <unk>
<unk> again.
They put some mutations there.
And it tries to go again and do it again with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in particular cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that will cause numbers in absolutely perfect way.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They are <unk>
But do you meet the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety that you get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that do it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
Once I was in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> <unk> doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than that produces normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that we are.
In that sense, it's going in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much faster than this.
So it is <unk>
The thing getting faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a moment analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to help me give up some of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I was dealing with my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, it's approaching the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
<unk> is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a very good baseball team.
I'm focusing on one of them and I hope many of you have heard of it.
It's called the average <unk>
And we talk about 300 percent of a <unk> <unk>
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and anyone who tried to <unk> the first base, not to get time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
Three <unk> <unk>
You know how to call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the team of the stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody who 10 <unk> can get to four <unk>
<unk> like the <unk> Ted Williams, the last player in the Great <unk> of <unk> in running more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I <unk> this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose they have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon that has also a record for 400 to <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place and a wish has two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family physician leads to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But you know something?
She's getting a lot out of a lot of this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask you.
What do you think should be the average hits of a heart surgeon or <unk> a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the matter is nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is they send me to the world, and I included, with <unk> to be perfect.
That would never, ever make a mistake, and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> obsessional student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs studied to a blood test.
<unk>
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nurses of <unk> General <unk> General <unk> not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
In my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> the <unk> of each artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnosis of <unk> <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> of <unk> on how to classify the <unk> <unk>
And as much more <unk> and more knowledge.
And I was really afraid, I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> of the school school with the impression that if you <unk> everything, then you would know everything, or you can close it to the whole thing, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought to the lunch lady in the emergency service where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the <unk> service.
And when I requested the emergency room to a cardiologist that touched me to that patient.
And they report to the head of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which gave me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these are <unk> with blood, and so there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment of the treatment, and I started working on the treatment.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in your heart.
I gave it <unk> pills of water, so that I could eliminate liquid <unk>
And in one hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> I sent it home.
I actually made it two more mistakes.
He sent it to her house without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't have the phone and I did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring some <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to spend a constant.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send her home, I had no attention to a voice that was like, <unk> it's not a good idea. Don't <unk> it.
In fact, I was so insecure that I asked the nurse who was <unk> <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to your <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to complete <unk> "Yeah, I think it's right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed the high, and he signed up with the ambulance and she took her to her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I <unk> to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that time, I did something that I don't do normally, too.
He went through the emergency room on the road service.
And there is another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady in the lady before, but another hand, he said three words, those three words that most of the emergency doctors <unk>
Other specialists fear it too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk> <unk>
"It remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Yes, she <unk> with the same voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and the edge of death.
In an hour of having come to his house, after I would give her a high school, he suffered from her family and her family called the emergency room with a <unk> pressure of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock <unk>
I was just breathing and I was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all their resources.
They were given medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
It had a mixture of sentiments because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy, and I was waiting for all hope to be <unk>
And in the two or three days was clear that we never <unk>
He had a permanent <unk> damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, they <unk> what was happening.
And in ninth day, they let them go. The lady <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names they die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks -- I was embarrassed by this and I experienced the shame shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat on alone, isolated without feeling that shame shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make our peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves an teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was bad, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I am sure that I <unk> things and made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he send him home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made I made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose <unk>
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in one day <unk> opened the sky and finally opened the sky, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if we were going to <unk> the efforts to be perfect to not make more errors, would do wrong those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it turned out to happen.
Two years later, I was an airplane in the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into her throat, was a little bit <unk>
They sent him up penicillin and sent him home.
But while he was headed to the door was following his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my <unk> <unk> my head asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I made the three words: <unk> <unk>
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and she didn't have a <unk> <unk>
It had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but the top, you can cause the closing on those tracks.
He, fortunately, she didn't die.
You get antibiotics on the <unk> and you recovered and <unk>
And I went through the same amount of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
<unk> an X-ray of kidneys, but it was normal. A colleague who was checking the patient and he was looking at the patient in the bottom right and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
So I took a liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
I went back and seeing some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and they recovered well.
But every case I was <unk> I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful has been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here is the problem: if I can't come back and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show them this so that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would put a place like this, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure.
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- I think I would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> that they make mistakes and the ones that no, those who can't sleep, and the ones that know; those who have <unk> results and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like an antibody reaction to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to the people who make mistakes, we're going to be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I have made a medical review study, and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for Toronto to my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes are happening every day, where one in every 10 drugs that are in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where <unk> infections are more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 24,000 24,000 <unk> of medical <unk>
The U.S. Institute of Medicine, established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should be.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is divided every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with pain on your chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain, comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things the same.
And my patients are not <unk> they don't <unk> their symptoms always the same way.
For all this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we are <unk> and we eliminate all the professional health care professionals -- well, they will not be anyone.
And with that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art, <unk> <unk> is a custom of saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everyone, from the <unk> to the head of surgery -- this is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. "What are your <unk>
And their students were <unk> <unk> down the head and <unk> saliva and start counting their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
<unk> <unk> is human, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They <unk> their experiences with them.
It's support for those of you who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way and support for everyone to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what to me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
Recently I did a survey over 2,000 people and the average number of choices that he says to pick an American American, are about 70 to a day.
Not a lot, on a research on a week to a group of CEOs of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks that were made by these executives and the time that we were going to be able to make decisions about these tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs per week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required one hour or more of their time.
Now think of their elections.
Do you know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How does the way the way those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choice to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about a few solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When you ask a question, like I'm blind, your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, you're ready to hear the problem of the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this very, very <unk> supermarket at least at that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> water, and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that shop, but I was on one occasion asked myself, why never I buy anything?
This is the shelf from the oil <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> box that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists coming in every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had <unk> different classes.
I took a place for <unk> right to the store.
We put it out of six <unk> or from 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First, where people were willing to stop the <unk>
More people stopped when he had <unk> an <unk> that when there were only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
From the time they stopped when he had only taken only three percent of them to buy <unk>
From the <unk> when there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably <unk> <unk> -- less good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> change is affecting us rather <unk> decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the subject of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for retirement retirement about a million Americans, from a few <unk> plans from this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of <unk> available in savings plans for retirement, <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, until 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding funds were less participation.
So if you look at the ends, we see that in the plans that they offer two funds, the rate of participation was from 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that we offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, the more it was the number of choices, more people would get paid for the actions or hedge funds.
As much as more options, they were more willing to invest in financial <unk>
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing to do, is that we will make the decision, even when it goes against the self-interest.
They're more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> even if objectively it going to go better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that giant range of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for how to make us contrast and choose that awesome <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so they can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than anymore.
People are always mad when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space on <unk>
But what we're seeing is what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut, you get rid of the strange <unk> options, there'll be an increase on sales, <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When I was <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> -- you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> eliminated the products for the <unk> of cats that are less <unk> the <unk> in <unk> per two higher sales and less costs.
You know the supermarket shelves of today, on average, give 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store, it's about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world today is <unk> and there was just 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to drive better choices is <unk> David <unk> the Harvard program.
All the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a safe fund of life.
For those of you who really want to choose to choose you have 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk>
The first thing I do is ask <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if their employees can't afford it, they can't be able to do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience to be willing to offer people in this audience to all paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to get it, and then I want you to give you a round of applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk>
Are you not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think it really meant to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first trial, than at the second trial, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the <unk> <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very <unk>
Why is people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when it uses debit cards or credit than when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that it looked more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to make more people.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And at that meeting, they <unk> exactly how they <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that he gave the staff to think about the positive things that we would think about in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a <unk>
We saw that in the supermarkets that they were <unk> throughout the <unk> <unk> exhibit can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there are a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
Turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This is a completely useless.
<unk> need to indicate something to whom we don't know the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
She was supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if we just get it a little bit.
We have to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very good decision that you buy a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows us to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to put your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> color outside of the car. I've got 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is make the order of the order in which the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from lots of options, 56 colors, to a few days ago, four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, so many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How much you are.
If you <unk> the <unk> button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
What we found is that the ones that are going from a lot of choices to another, <unk> the button over and over again and another one.
<unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, you keep there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which information is presented with.
If we start with the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Even though the choice of the change box doesn't say nothing about the preferences of inner <unk> and in all ways we make a choice.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
So sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can run more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I introduced them were designed to help drive the <unk> or better, to you to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful to the <unk>
And the more careful let's be in our best choices we can do to practice the <unk>
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> years in front of Germany -- <unk> if you had a typewriter <unk> I had to <unk> the government.
I had to record a leaf of text from written with the machine.
And this for the government to track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written with the wrong message, they could trace the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, so much that this is <unk> the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having some little yellow yellow dots on each page that you follow a pattern and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody looks like a lot of fun for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, a lot of <unk>
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means by illegal <unk> to steal money from our bills when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a computer computer.
The secret secret to the U.S., two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know her <unk>
And I say today it's more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes from evil to worse.
In the future, most American crime crimes are online.
The second group of <unk> in importance is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, and motivating them the protests, they motivate them to make laughter.
<unk> like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a major role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do it for money, <unk> like Anonymous that they do to protest and the last group are the United States and the governments that we <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority from the Netherlands, or, actually, it was.
It <unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
It would take the safety of the site and put up a <unk>
And last week I asked at a meeting with Dutch government representatives, I asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> the death of people because of the attack on <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how does people die from a suicide attack.
<unk> is an authority authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what do you treat <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign <unk>
And they would destroy <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters <unk> the headquarters for the British secret police headquarters in April 2011 and during the building of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of citizens in the country.
They had been sold this tool for 300,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments give them tools to governments to make them do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, only a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It <unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think about things like these the obvious answer should be said, "Well, it looks bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do you <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we think about today, will be forever.
Do we mean in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the South Park National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, the background, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park has no fences in the largest part of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and that's why we value it.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
They were dying of the warriors who protect our community and livestock and they are also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think there are so few in the National Park, National Park.
A child in my community, for six to the age of nine years is responsible for the livestock of their father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought male lions were scared.
But I realized that actually not <unk> because even helping male lions to see the ice <unk>
I didn't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
And I was trying to trick the lions so they believed that he was near the <unk>
But lions are very smart.  They came the first day and they saw the <unk> and they go, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing isn't moving, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions didn't come.
I discovered that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that you will turn out and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp from a <unk> <unk>
We got everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and battery electricity to the little <unk> <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the box <unk> makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get out of the outside, because that's where lions.
And that's how you see the lions you see as lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> to lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never went back to a problem with lions.
And the houses in the neighborhood you heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
The <unk> can look at the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now by Kenya, to frightening other predators like <unk> <unk> and also being used for <unk> elephants to farms.
Because of this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funding and <unk>
I even took my friends into my community and we installed light in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a boy in the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see flying planes and said that someday I would be inside of one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time.
My great dream is to become an engineer of aviation and pilot when it grow.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and lions, we can be with lions without the conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't think the exciting thing that is to listen to a story like yours.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working in other electrical inventions of electrical inventions in electrical inventions here.
What's the next thing on your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close <unk> CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you have invented electric fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: So I <unk> it once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: <unk> <unk> Richard <unk> is a big thing.
We are going to <unk> in every single step that I call a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
and I grew up singing a song called "No <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spent all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot from the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea, until it all changed a suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
And he said, "When I think about this, the five members of the family will stop in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two past weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we are ready to die."
It was very altered.
I was the first time I heard people were suffering from my country.
As long as I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child <unk> in his arms looking at the face of her mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine ripped off North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during starvation and only a few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more <unk> the energy <unk> everything around me was completely dark at night except by the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is an North Korean picture in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the Amazon River, which serves to boundary between North Korea, and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes I see bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought that would be separated from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like refugee <unk>
But soon as I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, it's too dangerous, because the refugee refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested for Chinese police and <unk> in the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life would end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a official told somebody "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many people can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though there were <unk> were eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans did not get so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to <unk> many other North Koreans have not had so much luck.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight as hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, everybody can play it in an instant.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to have a <unk> going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
And also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
It even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call with me.
Although I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I started to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming one.
The North Korean authority was something that I sent to my family, and as <unk> my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location outside the <unk>
They had to flee it immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea, and South Korea, in <unk>
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and I went to the border of North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> it in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> I took a week, and we almost were caught by several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and <unk> by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the <unk> and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, she <unk> I stood up and told me that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
I looked at me, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the <unk>
After paying <unk> and the bribes, was released in a month.
But at the time, my family was arrested and imprisoned again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did all by release my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison in a short distance from the South Korea.
I was going to come up with the <unk> office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would want to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and the other two North Koreans and <unk>
I was <unk> with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I get <unk>
"I'm not <unk> I said.
"I am helping the village to <unk>
I realized that it was a symbolic moment in my life.
The gentle unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the <unk> people when I <unk>
And I showed me that the goodness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the <unk> people need it.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea, we met in South Korea, in South Africa.
But achieve their freedom is just half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they <unk> a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices of the English language, business practices and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea, and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are in touch with family contact still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Korea, so I want to help North Korea, a chance to flourish international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and North Koreans all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> fast food <unk>
So the city planners come together, and they thought, let's change the name of South <unk> to represent something else, so they changed it to the Los Angeles -- as if this is <unk> what's really wrong in the city.
This is the South L.A.  <unk> <unk> food, <unk> <unk>
Like <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert, Los Angeles and South <unk> home to the places of food to take and eat in the car.
What's interesting is that the food places to keep killing more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in the Los Angeles <unk>
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times as we say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
And I was glad to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> wheels and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
<unk> is the problem and the solution.
And I got tired of driving for 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land that we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet by 45 feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to hold it up.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this was how I decided to hold it up.
So my group and I, L.A. Green. And we start planting our food forest <unk> trees -- you know, nine <unk> <unk>
What we do is, we're kind of a <unk> group of <unk> all over the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city came to me on top of it, and <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to take my own garden, the <unk> became reverse chronological order.
And I said, "Go on it?
A <unk> order in planting food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  So I was like, "Well, you know, <unk>
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. had the story written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition to <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> millions of <unk> plants.
Why on Earth don't look like this?
We put a plant to a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivating your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up in there, <unk> my children there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
As an artist of <unk> that <unk> walls, I <unk> <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the earth can do, if they leave their canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing a <unk> and how it affects the people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became an education tool, in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You try to see how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, which came a mother and her daughter, who was like the <unk> at night and they were in my garden, and I went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this that way.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people that I was so close to me with hungry, and this just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes people will steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh my God, I'm not afraid that you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to <unk> but in turn, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, gave me his stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed -- so just for a moment.
So the Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 garden.
We've had 50 people who are coming, work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If kids grow <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> you're going to eat <unk>  But if none of this are <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind what they put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they're caught. I see children of color that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are <unk> their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into healthy <unk>
I didn't get <unk>
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try and work to people, to get kids out of the street who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening food markets of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
<unk> take their <unk> OK?
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I'm not calling me if you want to sit in some comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so that you can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road here.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, in which it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water on the asphalt that you <unk>
And especially if you go on your bike and these cars go -- that's not really nice.
Also, the asphalt can do a lot of noise.
It's a loud material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, close to cities, we would want a road <unk>
The solution for that is to do <unk> roads.
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can move through it, so all the water of rain flow into the sides and they will have a road for which it's easy to drive, and not <unk> water.
Noise is also <unk> in these <unk>
Because it's very <unk> all the noise away, so it's a very quiet street.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is it <unk> You see that on this road the stones of the surface goes down.
First stone takes first a stone, then several more and more, and so on, and <unk> well, won't do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead more and more damage.
Sometimes they can build with that.
<unk> Is it ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but you have a solution.
And here you can actually see how the damage comes into this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> the light <unk> the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> they <unk> and if they <unk> they will be <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So if you drive around the road, you get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> <unk> of that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the <unk> steel <unk> and we can mix those little bits up with the <unk>
So we got asphalt with little bits of steel <unk> in it.
Then you need a machine, like you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel -- it's very good at that.
So what you need to do is you need to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big machine to <unk> here the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm put on to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
So we tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> where we had to make a <unk> <unk> to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this lasts lasts several years without any damage. That's what we know of practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did age aging -- we put the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using steel, fibers bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the road surface -- you can even double the life of the surface, and you can even save the life of the surface.
And now, of course, you're curious about it as well.
We still have this shown here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how the repair.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having aroused a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC News on his little gray radius of him.
He had a great smile on his face that he was unusual at those times, because news is generally <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban took out of Afghanistan and made the girls illegal to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister that I couldn't be used outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we were taking a different route so that no one could suspect where they <unk>
We had to hide the books in market bags so that we were shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us <unk> in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we <unk> our lives, the teacher, our students and our parents.
Every school once in school, he suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters was <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> that his daughter, my mother, out to school and why his father was <unk>
But my mother educated became a teacher.
This is her.
It was left two years ago, just to convert our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first one of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk in not educating their children.
During the years of the <unk> I remember that there were moments that I was very frustrated by our life and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can choose to leave your house during a war.
But there is one thing that you will always be with you, what's here -- and if you have to sell your blood to pay your education, we will do it.
So, you still want to be <unk>
I'm 22 years now.
I grew up in a country which has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women have more than the age of my age, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here in <unk> College in <unk>
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my college degree, but I was also the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it on the streets in Kabul.
My family thinks about me.
I dream in a big dream, but my family has even more big dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of what <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families that, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite even in front of a <unk> opposition in the <unk>
As a <unk> It's not his name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and it was literally <unk> of being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, you get the phone, a voice told you that if I kept sending your daughter to school, you'll go back to it.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but it doesn't hurt the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> <unk>
What I've realized about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of their daughter and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who were to school are told to remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
I think these changes didn't last a lot, after the retirement of the U.S. troops in America.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents to <unk> for them, that the <unk> I see a <unk> future and <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> would get it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never come back with a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the revolution was inspired by <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution as <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of rage and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And the <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were in the <unk> edge, the fall of the regime, <unk> <unk> dignity and social justice.
You've shown a benign courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and a few losses from about 50,000 dead -- we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have loved them, next to many other women, rebuild civil society, <unk> a inclusive and fair transition to democracy and national reconciliation to democracy.
There were approximately 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the decline of <unk> roughly 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I began to organize workshops about development and skills of leadership.
With an amazing group of women we started the <unk> of Women <unk> by <unk> a women's movement leaders, of <unk> leaders, to advocate for <unk> autonomy from the woman and by our right engagement in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> which was increasingly <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was <unk> and successful.
Women won a <unk> Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Another day we <unk> with the news of the murder of the American <unk> and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of military officers in the army.
And every day, every single day, we woke up with the government of <unk> and his <unk> human rights violation of inmates and their lack of law.
Our society, made a <unk> mentality, and it has been away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and vengeance became icons in the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to <unk> with our success story of <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm right here today to tell you, as a nation, we chose badly, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
So what happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policy of domination and <unk> as much as men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the women's values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than the election needed the <unk> and the <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the female more than the <unk> representation and quantitative <unk>
We need to stop acting as agents of <unk> and call days from anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which not only <unk> but also put the mercy of <unk> rather than <unk> collaboration instead of competition, inclusion <unk>
These are the ideals that an Libya, <unk> by war, desperately needs the end to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about <unk> and <unk> between women's perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran -- <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the traditions of <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> that spans all of the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the people have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus completely covers the <unk> that grows into the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all the existence.
This is how it tells us "My mercy to all the things."
This is how you say, "My mercy <unk> about my <unk>
That all of us are <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you today about a <unk> question, which has an equally <unk> answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that you're all going to deal with is why she's left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. He had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> green <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, me, <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man, I would love more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> them with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor from domestic violence.
I'm <unk> at English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies, <unk> <unk> between these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been going married almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three kids.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message to you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all of the religions, all the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> and long duration or that otherwise in the families, the last place we would want or we would expect to find a <unk> reason for which, for domestic abuse, turns so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world to sit with a man who <unk> and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women in the age of 16 and 24 times have three times more likely to be the victims of domestic violence than those of the ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands -- in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold, <unk> night in January.
I was sitting on my side in the subway in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a college <unk> university and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a field.
I had some big <unk> as blocks, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the very beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it especially at the beginning of a <unk>
We started to go out and loved all of me, which was a list that had gone to Harvard, that I would put passion to girls teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer as a woman, as no one had ever done before.
And it was why the arts degree in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence relationship is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> I left my work and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> that was entering a physical trap and financial <unk> and carefully <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to it.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where you're supposed to <unk> I had to feel so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another that kept the pillow underneath the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed these guns to cause the trauma that she lived with small.
I needed them to feel secure.
But these guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never been lifted up my hand, my life already was serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack on <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning, and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 <unk> of my neck had disappeared, put me up my girlfriend <unk> and I married him.
In spite of what had happened, I was sure that we lived happily ever forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
It was just very <unk> by the wedding and for the fact of making a family with me.
It was a isolated accident, and it never would hurt me.
I spent two times more on our <unk>
The first time I was driving down to a secret beach and he <unk> me, and he gave me so strong on the head that he <unk> several times a car <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our head of honey, was <unk> by traffic and threw a Big Mac <unk>
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control is that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why do I get <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help <unk> to tackle the <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why just don't <unk>
Why not <unk> me at any time.
To me, this is the most sad and painful question that people do, because we are victims, we know something that you are usually incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence occur after the victim has actually gotten to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include <unk> permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has become <unk> <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's not <unk>
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> it beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
He told everybody the world to the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family friends, full of strangers, and I'm here today because all of you <unk> me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
So for some people is a way to say <unk> it's by <unk> as if the victims are <unk> <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also <unk> who learned a lesson from what happened to them and to <unk> their lives joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I am a victim and a survivor for a very typical domestic violence.
I got married with a nice, cute man and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to come back to have never more, is a <unk> gun pointing to my head in the hands of somebody who says that I will.
Right now, as you're thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they were being <unk> they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, her sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love of love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> alone in silence.
They have the power to end with domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They <unk> the <unk> of light talking about it with their children, their <unk> their friends and family.
<unk> your vision of survivors as a fantastic <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence for intervening consciously, to slow their climb and show the victims a safe return.
Together we can turn our beds, our tables and our own families in the <unk> and <unk> that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. My name is Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point, there's a awkward tension in the room because I shouldn't have dress in this way.  Luckily, I've brought her clothes to <unk>
This is the first change in clothing on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to <unk> now, but they will find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
So these <unk> are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to move this sweater through the head, because it's when they're going to laugh at me, so they don't do anything while he covers me.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but <unk>
I have changed totally what you thought in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I was going to <unk> the back and I <unk> the hair of the kid.
Of course, except for surgery or an artificial tan like that I did two days ago for work, there are very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how are you going to be model?
I always say, a <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk>
Well, over the last centuries we have not just defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have been associated with a high and <unk> shape -- to the <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've known to use to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> that are <unk> <unk> There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York City told each and every role of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- <unk> models, just less than four percent, were not white percent.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take care of that.
But then, what would actually tell each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> or poet, which would be awesome, because you'd be the first.
If after this <unk> <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of <unk> in American magazine or the executive executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're bigger.
It's out of your control, it's surprising, and it's not a work you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate everything that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've got the studies, and you have a copy and a lot of work on your back, no matter what you <unk> I mean, if you <unk> you want to be president of the United States, but your copy <unk> <unk> <unk> for 10 years, people would be <unk>
The next question that people are always doing is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have a <unk>
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a child.
So I was presented with my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a party party a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They're <unk> <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> people and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always asking me is, let's make things for free?
I have too many <unk> heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to take any money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> stepped into a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> out of these privileges because of my looks, not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for what they look like, no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, of the teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times are I <unk>
When I research on this talk, I learned that the 53 of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little <unk> and you have the most bright hair, you will feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we <unk> it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also amazing to be able to work with creative and ingenious people.
And all of that is true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask, with some smaller legs and the most bright hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs and the brightest <unk> and the <unk> but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial racial and gender oppression when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to stand in this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in the perception of your success and the failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was much older enough to hold up a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures -- and I didn't get me who the <unk>
There were no directors and no <unk> and no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a very small care of the light.
In fact, most of them were taken random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife brought me this picture by holding my daughter on his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and the 5.
He just heard that we came back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what's coming now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said, why don't you take you to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
This is when we start to ask the tourists who were going to make us get the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is that universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has gone on with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much we would change life this journey.
It became sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had occurred that day in the way that a five-year-old could understand.
These pictures are much more than a representations of concrete time or a specific journey.
It's also a way of stopping time in a week of October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spent together is something that we hope with illusion all the year.
Recently, in one of the trips -- we were walking, when all of a sudden, he stopped in my tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the fleet of dolls that were <unk> from small <unk>
And he described to me what was the five years of standing in that same place.
<unk> that remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create are memories that we do.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I won't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always getting the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you don't want to go back to somebody and asked, and you get out a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> group.
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter, and the characters <unk> silly <unk>
More recently, if you've been following the press and they had laughter, and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that I associate with the <unk> Parliament but I don't accept.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't have clean the environment.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly in <unk> like <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> World <unk> where we have 16 species from these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are they important? First of all, they provide private ecological services.
It's our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
They <unk> the cadavers into the bone.
They help kill all bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax that it will not be for them to spread and caused huge losses from livestock and diseases into other animals.
Recent surveys have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses are three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of disease spread from disease.
<unk> also have huge historic importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of <unk> and the maternity and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the middle and the <unk>
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are very important <unk> to open sky -- in places like Eastern Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead and bury the <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What is the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are extremely <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and the <unk> the <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of extinction, in the endangered list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey from livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned from veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Because there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- you have a huge <unk> of time to <unk> the number of cases of rage has risen greatly in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the major wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up in the top.
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds. <unk> in half.
They're <unk>
In Africa, there is a horrible trade trade from being killed to <unk> and to the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel for different countries, so we will focus on a home problem, it's not going to be at all.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that are <unk>
How can they help? It can become assets, to make noise. They can write a letter to their government and tell them we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, they will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors over the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw them fly without <unk> without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I run and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work for my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I'm not.   I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We were going to the 21, which Italians were good and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, all of you who are going to do it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people about Zambia to grow food.
So we got to <unk> <unk> in southern Zambia to this absolutely magnificent <unk> which descends down to the <unk> River and we teach the local <unk> growing tomatoes and Italians and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so what they were going to do to come to work, and sometimes they didn't get <unk>  We were quite sure that the local -- in such <unk> valley, had not had agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't get anything -- we just said, "Thank God we are here --  <unk> in time to save the people of Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa became <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato <unk> in Zambia, and this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is.
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "My God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here --  "Why don't you do it? You're never <unk>
I thought that only the Italians got <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what the Americans, what they did, and then to see what the French did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
Let's see the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that we gave people to <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we have delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about harm than that money has <unk>
They just read their book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries and we treat people just from two things: or the <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin words that means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if they were my kids, "I want a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if I were my <unk>
That's why white people are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face. <unk> little <unk> written by <unk> who said for all of economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman that opened this conference is put a cane on the floor, and he said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never just start anything, you ever motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have sleep to become a better person.
So what do you do? You <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and they sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We put together in a coffee <unk>
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, once instead of getting into a community to tell people what to do, why not once, for once, <unk> but not in community meetings.
I'm going to tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings there.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what do they have a <unk>
So planning has this <unk>
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't attending their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new profession.
The profession is the family physician from the company, the family doctor in the business, which is set up with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen table in the coffee, and helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia, city.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to move away from this <unk> junk where we came to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And so the government says, <unk> --  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of <unk>
Peter <unk> One of the greatest business <unk> in history, passed to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before I got involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the <unk>
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come up with you.
You have to offer you for privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> will come in a mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people -- intelligence and passion?
Which presentation you guys have <unk> more of this tomorrow?
<unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- we are <unk> fossils and we have not renewable <unk> and from one point to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> government?
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a lovely story that was in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> met this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't be within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million of horses that would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in <unk>  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared <unk> generic generic companies.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Michigan.
But there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk with you.
Then you have to offer an absolute absolute <unk>
And then I will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things -- the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have to have to have a fantastic marketing <unk> and you have to have a great financial administration.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be done, selling and search for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 companies of the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: No one was started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> <unk> in bars with their dedicated dedicated to their dedicated dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what someone who did for this <unk> who speaks to you, what does it need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Okay, you can <unk> You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> that he looks for <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us are around us, can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't switch much knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much they pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings, and understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes in the empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds a relief with the <unk> giant <unk> which are <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city of a city.
And there's a <unk> <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture of the world, but also one of the most beautiful architecture properties of the U.S.
I live near this house, and I thought how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and a lot.
And this produced me a profound gratitude for the time living and so on.
It gave the significant things to the significant things in my life today.
But I <unk> to keep this look in my daily lives.
I think it's easy that it's easy to be left to catch on day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this broken house on a giant slate and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before she died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what this experiment is, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die to die on <unk>  Before they die and I want to sit on <unk> in the <unk> line of <unk>
Before you die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before we die I want to live outside of the <unk>
Before I die I want to give you some more."
Before I die I want to go to the bailout <unk>
Before I die to die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned room became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at the <unk> and they <unk> me and gave me comfort at times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and new ways -- it's about <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the center of civic center we did a kit and now they've made walls in countries around the world, like South Africa, Australia, Australia, and beyond.
And together we show the power of our public spaces if we give ourselves the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to keep the perspective and remember that life is very short and delicate life.
Death is something that we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that will become more power.
If you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and with more means to share the hope and the people around us, the people around us, cannot help us improve places, can help us improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce my siblings.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's very hot.
It doesn't speak, but it brings joy out of some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's shared. <unk> happens what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color color.
They don't care about religious differences and look at this: never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to say the words that I couldn't even be <unk> it reminds me of one thing: the little thing we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year that I came out every one of the songs of my iPod, <unk> conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady birthday <unk>
They don't seem <unk>
But most people disagree with it.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> of society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what led my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although we wouldn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: they were <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In each individual of it is in a different way, from there that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of development that faster increases in the world, there is no <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in myself.
I was living and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure on the smaller things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking around the washing machine and eating anything that was in the <unk>
As it was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a kid who saw the world without biases, a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, moments where I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change the normal.
<unk> passes by the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that one is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you might not have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences you <unk> are a <unk> Each one of us has a gift in their inner and, frankly, the pursuit of normal, is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time where we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit about what must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State made me a communications teacher to give a class of communication to students in engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> of truth to these students with his big minds, their big books and their big unknown and unknown words.
But as those conversations, I felt what was <unk> must have felt that when it fell down the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
So I sat down when I had those conversations with the students with the students. I would surprise the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We need desperately a huge communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the environment and healthcare and health care -- and if we don't know about it, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question to <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that they study <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing their science, care of <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> affordable is not the same thing to make dumb things.
Instead, as Einstein said, it's all as easy as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies -- are ways to hook and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you ever wondered why they call <unk>  What do you do? <unk> kill and <unk> your presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's supporting too much in the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple statement, <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphs that will be <unk> to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they are <unk>
I think these are just a few keys that can help others open the door and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English English is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public <unk> no matter whether you are <unk> platform or principle, and that, when he wins, it gets it by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means.
Something you see with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed the words to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
They put it in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to tackle them, and at the end had such popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's by a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were presented to all kinds of suggestions that they could have <unk>
Some people wanted to call it the State of <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people just want to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And they didn't even have the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed <unk>
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired of <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and I always <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it King if he was giving him to him or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> more <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate title of it.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was no longer before, but it only meant <unk> that I <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "You can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take you seriously with a degree as ridiculous and <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite way to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as a title title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep out there, waiting for the Senate between in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this, I want to tell you about -- is that the title of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads to <unk> the largest economy of the world and a fleet of aerial air vehicles and so on.
Reality and history have disappeared, the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was <unk>
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate I won and the House of Representatives -- because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and I think that I would like to <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually actually change a lot more words than what these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 at feet under land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but above all, that cacophony of <unk> <unk> and stones are <unk> with primitive tools with primitive tools.
Like others -- I carry a cheap <unk> of light <unk> it holds the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole that goes down hundreds of meters on the ground.
He <unk> my hand, and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost the control and dropped countless feet in that hole.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep deep at that hole with no pay, and they never dying.
I went out of that hole and went home, but they may never will, because they're prey to slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 continents and, in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was the world in the world, but not such a degree.
When we finished talking to me, I was very sad, I honestly was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> her stomach and, weeks later, flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
And so I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of Africans displaced throughout the entire slave <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of <unk> <unk> today.
However, today, you can strive to whole families for generations -- <unk> dollars.
Surprisingly, slavery generates more than 13 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with fake good education promises and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the <unk> goods in the slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everyone and yet it's illegal to all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This weird and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> on a temperature of 54 degrees Celsius -- C, men, women, kids, in fact, whole families -- all entire families <unk> in a heavy <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> in their heads, and they carry them with <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made it pee out pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera was turned too hot to the touch, and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment for these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side -- I quickly grabbed and said, <unk> don't <unk> Don't do this here."
And he explained very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
They could put them in a worse situation than they were gone.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his liberation and he complained that he was <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found kids carrying stones for miles on <unk> terrain to trucks that were hoping down.
These big <unk> were more heavy than the children who were charge and the children <unk> their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> cut entirely their houses.
When you hear the word <unk> we often think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness I told me that it would be hard to me work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
It took me through some <unk> <unk> which gave this dirty <unk> <unk> light <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they're local <unk>
They have small rooms and private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven -- are forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every place is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember a kind of <unk> fear and, in that moment, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where I was <unk>
There were no <unk>
There was no big windows like <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because we touch a very difficult thing, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as a slave mother.
This is everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families <unk> in the <unk> trade.
This is a family portrait of family.
The black hands of black are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 <unk> children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake.
When we got there, I went to look very fast.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family on a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids, some younger children.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families and <unk> and forced to work <unk> in these boats in the lake, and even though not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up there was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
The branches of <unk> trees <unk> in Lake <unk> and often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear of fear, it's thrown into water to release the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and like all of life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it's the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one of the <unk>
<unk> and <unk>
And it fits to point that these networks weigh more than 400 kilos when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village <unk>
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi resides as possible.
Who will get to be because somebody decided to make a difference in their life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partnerships from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their motorcycle suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
And he asked us to <unk> it by a path to the forest.
At the end of the road, we were terrified of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
And then he pointed out that path just visible and he said, "This is the path, this is the road.
As we started down, we removed the <unk> that I <unk> the path and after walking around an hour and found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as I <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up <unk> in one of us, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children strapped on their back, and as they were looking for gold and <unk> in hot waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in the other part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember I looked at his <unk> <unk> eyes, because many of them had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits are up to 90 feet and these people carry heavy stone bags that then they will be shipped to another area where the stone would be able to extract the gold.
To the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if we look closer at it, the margin is to work at other less fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up as this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> per few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
When he died, his uncle, <unk> his debt of the uncle is what force it to be slave in mines.
When I met him, he had been working in the mines and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so severe that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it is forced to work night and day on that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this kind of determination, in the face of a remote, <unk> which is inspired by a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen by you all around the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to be testimony to them and we're going to do everything in order to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as humans, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not <unk> These are real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images wake up a force in which you see it, in people like you, and I hope that that force turns on a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math and applied and there's a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> are like the management <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We got rid of the ballet <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see later on.
But the <unk> demand a degree of extraordinary training -- a high-level skill level and probably a certain <unk> <unk> that can actually have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability to do with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a <unk> penguin dancer at the time.
In the last few years, it has been made up to the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately the only way we will know whether there's really a cure when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it is frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement not <unk> so they don't serve blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside clinical trials, you never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients were able to get the exam <unk>
It wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is that I want to <unk> as a <unk> form for a try, you see, in a sense, we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of vibration <unk>
It shows somebody healthy as it emits sounds like <unk> Can we imagine as dancers from a vocal ballet ballet <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes for example.
And, as they knew it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time that leads to a child learning to speak.
So from the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as <unk> and so the Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these examinations based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
They're both <unk> OK, but also the <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're less cost, and we all know what happens to happen.
When something takes a <unk> it appears on mass scale.
These are some amazing targets for <unk>
We can reduce the patient <unk>
I would not need to go to the clinic for <unk> routine.
<unk> <unk> we could get goals.
We could do a massively low cost for clinical trial for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when I give you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Women's <unk> <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start dealing with these targets.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> can call under price and <unk> for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's take all these samples of, say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What do you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the so-called you have to indicate if you have or not the <unk> <unk>
<unk> You can see, some people may not be <unk>
But we're going to get a very big sample of <unk> data in different circumstances and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion factors looking for the real markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have a <unk> <unk> at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works in the mobile phone network, too, what we <unk> the project. We now have one percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
After March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are creatures <unk> creatures.
We were <unk> in the darkness, in rooms without windows and generally we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin still even more perfect -- we do the impossible possible thing, and we were <unk> in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of experience and a real taste of the images and a real taste of the images and the photograph.
On March March 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events in Japan.
And a few time later, an organization where it was voluntary <unk> there was a <unk> where they were in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people that were affected by the wave.
The level of water has gone over 24 feet tall and over three miles a land inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
<unk> rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools.
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> out of the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers and neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> photos and cameras and <unk> cards.
Everybody did the same.
<unk> and bring them to different places from villages around the villages for <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As I was fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon anything that they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
He helped clean up the silent toilets, the enormous, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor of that day to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went through myself as my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the photos, I found some of them more than a hundred years old, some were still in the lab in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking of how to fix that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to be <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise, that little girl would not have the way she looks like, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over time, they got more <unk> and they need more <unk> and so it came into Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks, I had 150 people who were <unk>
In Japan, in July, we <unk> to <unk> a village north of <unk>
Once the week we use our scanner in <unk> libraries that had <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could make an hour. I could make a few weeks.
I could make a few months.
This <unk> had to draw from practically hand using the areas whose color and detail the water was not <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures <unk> in saltwater, covered in bacteria, with algae, and even by oil with the step of the time I continue to <unk> because of that <unk> it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't <unk> the photo unless she was <unk> dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more of the photos already <unk>
As I once said, <unk> the leader of my group is like to make a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky, in relation to the photos.
He had started to <unk> she himself but stopped when he realized that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not be <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single picture, and he would take the full picture.
When I collected their pictures shared some of his history with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the pictures at a fire station between the rubble pretty far from where she used to be his house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter <unk> the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Your little children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find his whole family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him his pictures his younger son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that I could find out something that he could come back to look at, something that I could remember from the past that I would not have been labeled on that day of March when everything in her life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up there -- hundreds of them were helped to clean up a few more <unk> photographs, the great <unk> -- the vast majority of their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to bring to 90 families from totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them on ink to <unk>
We take pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, one place, a relationship, someone wanted.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would take to us, but the first thing we would take to look for.
So this was the project of restore small pieces of humanity, to return to someone with the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's an enormous difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger -- to bring something, using their talent for something that aren't thin skin models.
And to finish the end I'd like to read this email. He sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking of the people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the little girl -- gathering around a baby, and I was <unk> because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter <unk>
In the whole world, in all the few times our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that cuts through an apple in an exhibition in a single exhibition of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but to a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create video in slow motion of light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-ray and challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and switch it on and put it on a second or a second or a second or a second -- create a <unk> package of photons just a millimeter in size.
And that set of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a <unk>
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do they spread out these photons in this <unk>
What is the <unk> light <unk>
Now, all of this --                                   It takes it to travel the light of light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a <unk> package that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble that bounces inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table, and because of the reflections of the top you see in the background of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a standard and current bullet and we make it go down the same distance and see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much they think that would take us to sit on the film?
One day? A week? Actually a whole year.
It would be a very boring film, of a <unk> <unk>
And what about testing with <unk> nature.
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought, from a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look once on this <unk> you'll see that, as the light gets <unk> from the <unk> it's still bright.
Why? Because the tomato <unk> and light bounces on its inside and it turns out after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at all?
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture of the <unk> it comes into very little light, it comes in.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the <unk> <unk> so I can just go into some light.
We sent that <unk> that <unk> million times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw something out of light on the door. You go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
And we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will come back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also the hidden objects but we don't know what point corresponds to what a distance.
So when you project a laser and you can record a picture of the <unk> that you see on the screen, it really doesn't make sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, tens of images, the <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we be able to see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction of us.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> collisions with what's going back on the curve, to the turn of the curve, to the back of the curve, to the back of the curve, we can create <unk>
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light in the open windows by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> capable of looking at the inside of the body by having <unk> and the same thing for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new <unk> of visualization to solve the problems of the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, it became science in art, an art of <unk> photographs.
I realized that all of the data <unk> that we collect every time is not just for scientific <unk> but we can do that for scientific <unk>
So creating a new form of computational photography, with slow motion and <unk>
And look at those <unk> Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's something fun.
If you look at the waves underneath the <unk> these are going on from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which events are events in the world sometimes come in front of the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's already time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life and give you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
You can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
You can record a song, and you can put it back to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to look for a change.
This is the fall from 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were looking for a change, they had a phone in our pocket.
Who from <unk> have a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your cell <unk>
<unk> A Blackberry, wow!
It's too much every single cell phone today.
But today I will talk about me, my mobile, and how I changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> lines of information.
<unk> <unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission in the E.U. presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every single telephone company, the European <unk> every single Internet <unk> has to store a whole range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and until two years, in their phone company or their Internet <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone phone and the Internet providers, well, all this information about us.
There was lawyers, <unk> priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets in Berlin and said, <unk> don't <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> Vietnam.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all of this information about us?
Every time you use your <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest phone company in Germany, and please give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to <unk> and I didn't have a particular answer, it was all <unk>
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you're <unk> my life.
So I decided to give you a lawsuit judicial because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of it <unk> an agreement.
<unk> the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I first saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, "I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what data retention means.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and pull it back and forward.
You can see every step I want.
And you can see how I go from <unk> on the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a bit of fear.
But it's not only about me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call them between them.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communications network.
You can see how their people communicate to each other what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control its society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who is talking to whom, who sends an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders were the leaders, this had never happened.
The fall of the Wall Wall would have never happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and want to drive them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they come back home to their friends that privacy is the 21st century <unk> and it's not quite <unk>
When you go home, you get to your representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, you don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what you store for you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to tell you that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello God, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello God, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why we <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents are brothers, but they are.
Just by accidents, like the one that happened to me at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of you to present them.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they wish to be disabled.
We go for a walk.
<unk> <unk> are in the trade center, they drive around looking for parking lot, and what do you see?
16 empty places for the disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There is a <unk> of the <unk> I won the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> because a woman, I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might have to do it.
I'm from <unk> <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, it might.
Many people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters were <unk>
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents would <unk> to the school system and <unk> that I also went, and if we didn't take all the main note -- all the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk the five years putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me to make it <unk>
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and and ...
Yeah. The first day in the middle kindergarten was walking as a <unk> champion who received a lot of <unk>
Growing up there was only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 <unk> and I think no one realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a <unk> campaign.
The people that I grew up with had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> that died of starvation during the <unk>
I told them that he had enough fat to live three months without eating them without eating them -- so they <unk> at sunset very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or so I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to <unk> me as well.
And when my friends were going to spend a summer vacation at the coast of Jersey, I didn't go.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we were not going to go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were <unk> in <unk>
On the summer vacation I often was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> and put me hot cups on my back, <unk> me on the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes, and I remember the water <unk> the eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I should say it's very boring, but before we do yoga was a comedian of <unk> that I could not stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it on the head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital was at <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant for the <unk> University of the <unk> University because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> <unk> of the theater.
All of me.
I did all the tasks of the <unk> I took the top note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass <unk> my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called a very slow <unk> in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> when I finally got a <unk>
I have <unk>
<unk> <unk> At the end of <unk>
Thank God <unk> in order to be <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running at the director of the theater, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, asking her why and she told me that they could not do the <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the <unk> you can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that was literally born and gave it to an actor with no brain <unk>
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
When I graduated, I went home, and my first tour tour, was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I was there like a <unk> I didn't see myself more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> managers didn't <unk> <unk> not white, with disabilities.
Just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I became <unk>
In my first tour, I took comics from New York City to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that led to when she fell at the high speed of the New Jersey <unk> with a driver who had <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, with no veil.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to claim the first place, but I know they never heard that little little rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival in New York City, now in his <unk>
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind the science directors and to remind the game directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to the Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of disability.
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program in the wire, and it has Keith <unk>
I went out like a graduate dance, I went back to a studio and sat on a <unk>
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can you give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I cling onto the <unk> desk to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I stayed like the <unk> home and hit my chair.
Something like I learned in direct Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they never <unk> me or no older than me.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I put online clips like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What does the disease have?
We should really pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even that I'd like my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then they can't do someone in <unk>
<unk> are the <unk> Yeah, <unk> man.
We are the most big minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said not to <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with media media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would weigh less hate online.
Or maybe not.
We may still need all the society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I was going to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> by the great state of New Jersey in the University of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the Syrian refugee children, a tiniest fraction of what my parents would like.
It was the only time my father saw me live live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a young boy in a small town.
I don't know their name, but I know his story.
He lives in a little town to the South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> propels a small town to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
No for him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no work, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he comes up with him a man who offers it to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He knows a dynamic of people, who gives him a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes to send home, to her family.
They present to a young lady.
Finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a car bomb.
That little boy from that little town with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were <unk> a terrorist organization against al Qaeda.
So how did the story of a young people who were trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that got him from what we call "the <unk> <unk>
And the story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> <unk> riots in London, who seek something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of the city of jobs, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them the opportunities, the history of <unk> the door to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> to be the story of cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
Seventy percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They don't do practically anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember standing in the hospital in front of <unk> thinking, and if I never gone?
And if I had seen myself forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
He would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor some juvenile leaders at a business force.
It was going to be about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas on the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunities.
I remember when he told me, that because I was a graduate college college -- frustrated, was the perfect white <unk> for <unk> and other terrorist organizations, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to reach point A is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war, have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
She started to train themselves to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point going to go to hundreds of <unk> for the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this different?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the spirit spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so <unk>
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> We were from plastic from abroad.
If you told someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
He created a farm outside of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> that he said he could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it began the delivery of flowers for wedding -- creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now is working in the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
She wants to create a space where the families, young people, can go together, and as he says, smell <unk> <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the Mohamed presence had a really profound impact on the young.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGOs working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions to some of the major challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So to inspire young people to create a culture of corporate spirit -- it's really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation for <unk> in development and put in their businesses.
They <unk> young people with the resources they need, <unk> the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something more to start a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed isn't just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park, this is how it's called, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the <unk>
They gave them the opportunity to escape <unk> <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> that <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about ten years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> mountains, an area <unk> in the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not going to be on the way that we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings on <unk> that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a beautiful Lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with the hearts of apple -- aluminum <unk> and <unk> old.
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought were going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and a little bit <unk>
Who's clean our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where do you <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> the <unk> of <unk> tons of waste -- and 2,000 tons of <unk> <unk> every day.
I wanted to meet them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What do you feel to use your uniform and bring that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
He needed to be a lot more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I wasn't just traveling in the trucks. I was <unk>
And they operated the mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as <unk> as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong you get <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked in that for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every week.
There's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> waste is one of the ten most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and you're coming into the traffic all day and you're going through all around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible <unk>
I also learned about how relentless the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is as a force of nature itself.
It never lets come.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
You should always be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think strongly that the waste waste is the most important hand hand on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first protecting in public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the waste and effective way every day, this starts <unk> from its <unk> and its dangers inherent will affect us in very real ways.
So we had run for decades and centuries back to <unk> and they start to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for what the motor engines begin to fail when it's in danger of the consumption of the economy.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just put your relationship.
And then it's what I call our average daily <unk>
So with that, I mean simply at the speed that we used to move in the <unk> time.
We usually don't get <unk> and clean up or we cleaned up with us our cup of coffee, our bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We use it, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there's a work force on the other side that will be <unk>
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about garbage harvesting that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every single day in the street <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when you <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keeps us safe from ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after the 11th of 2001 I heard the <unk> of a collection collection of waste on the street, I grabbed the <unk> and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing her journey of paper like I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that day in particular, but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I started researching the garbage collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together a lot of times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have all the costs, even the real human cost of the labor of labor.
The municipal waste is what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the entire nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing you see to someone whose work is to clean up the trash of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection to think of our community life, to become part of the environment where architecture is naturally born from the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both of these projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And they also share the fact that different analysis of different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and to me, about what we had to design up.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very big stores in which people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this should not happen because it's a temperate weather that goes 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And third, its kind of thing has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place that is so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market that is this <unk> structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern building of several stories by applying these principles.
The next challenge is presented to the <unk> the site, which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, <unk> all the entries in the building.
And this extends into a <unk> <unk> which creates a space of the air in the building that is <unk> by its own shape of sun and rain.
And around this space we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, changing on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought about how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that <unk> the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue that was similar to a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the input to the air, and also the light <unk>
And then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> which are the windows that let go through the air and light in a way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center. It was not what they <unk>
But finally, we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the commercial center because at the end of accounts there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not just because of the material compared to the glass but also because it was no longer necessary to have air-conditioning <unk>
So we managed to get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy power to the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a great advantage to put <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk> <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, that they collect water for the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the greatest project, I needed to not just understand the city of Tunisia, but also to understand the environment, its own tradition and culture.
During that analysis I was especially interested in <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with 12 doors of connected access to almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation, we did was to expand the streets to create 12 initial blocks as similar in size and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some points in relation to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this change the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and so much natural ventilation.
So I <unk> a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections for <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that set higher density at the upper levels and a lower density of the plant down.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving up the community the space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and put them up and do such activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jumping from one building to another building.
These two examples, have a common approach to the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities growing up.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and local economies at the same rate growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment that they have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge loads of bright hair, and a little <unk> of <unk> <unk> It was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
And I finished that year and I was full of jealousy until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed with a time after I was coming out of school, I was a little evening, and I hid in the bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, took off the table of my teacher <unk>
And then I did.
I <unk> the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just a little bit.
All like this.  And I set up to bring the book back to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had really good notes as well.
So in a <unk> I would bring the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of you to all rows of <unk> and I was just a row -- just for being there, since I was there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It was all obvious <unk>
I never <unk>
But above all, I was struck by the reason why I was bothered by the reason that this little girl was so small, it was so small to <unk>
I love jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
The birds are also very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one <unk> cause in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab that you study <unk> in all its possible ways.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no case? It would have literature.
Well, I would not have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There was no king <unk> king and a <unk>
There was no Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading lists from high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, No <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as soon as the jealousy has all of them.
This year is done by 100 years of his work <unk> "In the time to <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the <unk> <unk> right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot about how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as tough as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat is <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why well they are going so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the regulations that are reduced to the person, their desire, to their <unk> are a very good <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel ours, we tell ourselves a story.
One story about people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details <unk> to <unk> the knife isn't it?
The <unk> make us all <unk> <unk> and that's something we <unk> understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure to give me to the other, maybe right now."
And it starts to say itself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every single charm that <unk> detects in his lover has adds it to his collection of <unk> instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
Is it an emotion. You have to <unk>
And what are the <unk>
<unk> <unk> out of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> they like the great quantities of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> were <unk>
That's why <unk> is so successful --  -- <unk> the language of the jealousy.
When <unk> is in their agony of jealousy, <unk> around the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're a scientific research with real <unk>
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are finding knowledge, search of truth, a really painful truth -- in fact, to what to <unk> the more painful the truth better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways for <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs -- that makes us suffer, it causes a lot of more profound feelings and vital man than a wise man who can be <unk>
It's telling us we're going to look for women who are going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> will reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud went visited by a very <unk> young woman who was being consumed with the idea that his wife was <unk>
And Freud says there was something weird in that man, which is not <unk> in what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or just accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of your wife.
So the novels are very good at this.
So the novels really described very well how <unk> make us look at the intensity but accurately.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we are becoming the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts or illegal <unk>
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me for eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan from 52 years old was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from which he would send me <unk> <unk> itself, for one year.
For one year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of her former student.
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge though <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and bright character from American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that deal with how jealousy, <unk> our minds -- and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in an instant.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to take off your own and <unk> you know, and it's under the floor -- and it's under the floor, you get your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> to everybody as much as I sometimes wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what characters are always doing when you're not sure, when you're in a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always heard of <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> rat <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but we <unk> it and <unk> in each one of those puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in <unk> <unk> once you <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who don't want to raise their hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional -- this scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> gets to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really an issue of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to get it from the greatness of the other.
We can engage with it.
But I like the plans for <unk>
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have fiction to <unk>
Only fiction fiction, jealousy.
fiction alone invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> the <unk> Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the <unk> Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence on the <unk> surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the biggest development in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo she gave about 400,000 people and asked the 20,000 <unk> <unk> universities and government agencies.
They died people, including the Apollo <unk> one.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men on the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which <unk> after death <unk> last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical response is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice <unk> in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some ask, why did the <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And they could also ask, why is climbing the <unk>
35 years ago, why fly on the <unk>
Why does it work Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
So we chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the east in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to <unk> <unk> of the powers of technology.
It was because it was great power to do it.
The landing on the Moon happened in a context of a long list of technology's <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the <unk> and the <unk> of smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a <unk> <unk> but in 1969, the Apollo <unk> 10 miles flew to 40,000 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human being has gone to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo 10, and the optimism <unk> about the power of technology has been <unk> by seeing that problems that we imagined the technology would be destroyed as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or to feed the world population appears to be <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't get to the <unk> tube of the rocket <unk> the <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would get the colonies on Mars.
So that somehow occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists had been distracted by us and they had enriched with trivial, these things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have extended and enriched our lives.
But they don't <unk> the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an explanation in the Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> <unk> Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> specifically, incentives that venture capitalists are offered to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the investment investment caused the creation of <unk> ideas by funding for <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the capitalists of risk were at their high point without worry about the risk of the minimum they had a small investment of investment that could be able to go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with benefit on technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and the development is in the long term. They have not been invested in the development of technologies that are dedicated to solving big problems because they don't have a direct commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are most complicated and profound.
Sometimes we chose to not solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things than doing on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because conservation systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption, from energy from renewable energy sources like solar -- wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want energy sources that can compete at the price, don't exist.
Now, technologists, the entrepreneurs and economists agree on which policies and international treaties to develop the development of <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development of energy, and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate of our current political policy that we will see an international energy policy or treaties that reflects that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seem technological, they will be not to be.
We know from time time that famines are a result of failure on the food <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or use for storage and food deal, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems are sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are many kinds of cancer, some brutally resistant cancer types, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
<unk> problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can have and we have to have -- but these four elements have to be <unk> political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it should be really about a <unk> problem.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it does with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no competition in the Cold War, as in the Cold War, there's no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there is no science mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the Moon it turned out to be straightforward.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't miss the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start to give you the <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a great decline of trust, it's a very general belief in it.
The second is an <unk> we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a target and a task, which I think gives you a clearest idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It makes me bow to think that it may have fallen down in some activities or institutions and that could have risen on others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can turn to <unk> polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the polls of opinion over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, continue to <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years are still quite <unk> and the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the road.
But it's this evidence for enough?
What <unk> opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you look at is the <unk> attitudes, that people are going to be asked when some questions are done.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
You probably ask by asking, "What for?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to place trust <unk>
We don't assume that the confidence that we're going to feel by a particular kind of <unk> a <unk> or a person, it's going to be uniform in every single time.
I could, for example, say that I trust a certain teacher teacher that I know to give the kind of <unk> but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it was not a good <unk>
I could trust my most <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we are leaving all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think surveys are very bad tools to measure the real standard of real trust, because they're trying to <unk> the good judgment of inherent to the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what happens to the goal?
The goal is to be more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I would have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> of not trusting what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who <unk> their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> which then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say that you say, yes, this means that what it matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is make a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in <unk> <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, in contrast, they are not responsible for us to not be responsible for them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they will <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm very pleased to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it is, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we're going to do, to argue before trust.
<unk> is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've been trying to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that made us easier the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> that I see <unk>
And we found the same problem in our entire public life, and they <unk> that the <unk> system that is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the <unk> evidence is actually doing the opposite.
What they're doing is <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks, like <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
You might all know similar examples.
They <unk> all of that, on the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you are going to be worthy of being worthy of trust and challenge people that we're safe and if you try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- which doesn't make it properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> to the task -- <unk> puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should be reconstruct trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately is defining because we give people a few other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough so that you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because of course, you can't usually lose it for all people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to give you a sense evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That is a day, everywhere, and it makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says that I can <unk> without giving the explanations out.
I take them back and get me back to the money, or I would change it by the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to do.
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is <unk>
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, a glass of a <unk> screen and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started to figure out how to <unk>
I first created this tool that steps into the digital space, so when the strong <unk> against the <unk> the physical body at the pixels.
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual <unk> underneath the screen.
So with this tool.
But both remain out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with the digital information using all the dexterity <unk>
In the <unk> <unk> division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on a keyboard on a digital area.
<unk> a transparent bombsight with depth cameras to detect the fingers and the face, now you can raise your hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and get the pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy as grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and pull out lines, or words or words with the virtual touch sensor that there are the bottom of every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
So in these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
And so many of us will have bought a lot of us and <unk> things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> virtual <unk>
This is the vision you get from a device into your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them be physicists so we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future look like?
At the MIT Media Lab with my <unk> Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we create this one <unk> <unk>
This imam imam behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach people physically and distance and the famous <unk> <unk> you can reproduce as a physical reality that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of the planets, the physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what is most fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday activities.
As you can see, digital information will not just show us something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without that we have to <unk> our world.
We started talking about a barrier, but if you <unk> that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to <unk> a school for athletes with all the <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After we survive the Cultural Revolution, they create firmly that there was only a way to <unk> a safe and <unk> work and <unk>
No matter if I work or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese <unk>
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start to <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio program.
But no adult <unk> the idea.
No adult took me.
Only my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew that it was too much more to train.
My dream never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class of happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to be <unk> OK.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books going on here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and much better than it is.
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> guilt <unk> and to <unk> the relationship with my parents.
I meet a new culture also led to my <unk> <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, at first this map this map I thought was out of place, because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are research fields to research like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if criminal reading worked for research, why don't we do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be about <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I will not come back to feel or powerless ever.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from, where the passion, where happiness comes from.
A dream <unk> can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, I'm here, happy living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in Berkeley psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex went into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on the couch <unk> couch grabbed my shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about her problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class <unk> had a <unk> as a first client.
And I got a <unk> that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories of <unk> that Alex brought to the <unk> it became easy to just move my head as they <unk> the solution.
"The <unk> of the new <unk> was saying Alex, and why I saw her, she was right.
You start to work later, you get home afterwards, you have children later, to death goes afterwards.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time in <unk>
But soon after, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to Alex who would talk about her life that would be <unk>
I <unk>
I said, "Yes, I come out with guys underneath his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> he said, "No, no, but maybe it's <unk>
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a pause in its development.
This caused the Alex <unk> to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences -- not just for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, and the future families and the future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent of the population, if you think no one comes into age without going to happen before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take off the dream of a <unk> I want to see. It's fine. <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the 35 years.
What this means is that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that are given to your life to have happened to when you have 30 and <unk>
People in the <unk> I don't panic.
This audience is going to be fine, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that more than half of Americans are married, or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and they <unk> to <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change yourself, now it's time to change it.
We know that personality.
<unk> are the time for <unk> on their body and their options.
When we think about the development, we all know that the first five years is critical for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an <unk> impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development, and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
<unk> talk about changes in the timeline of the <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't that true?
What do you think that happens when you get a <unk> in your head and you say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing happens.
And then every day, smart intelligent <unk> like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count, I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game play.
They all went running, but then somewhere around the 30, he turned out the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little end -- but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of us start a career, to choose a city, to choose a mate, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that you start to show you, which is a lot harder and miserable to do everything from once to the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> crisis is not about buying red <unk>
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
<unk> you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work in art or entertainment, but they couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living a very difficult time, their previous life had been even more difficult.
They often <unk> in our <unk> but then he would raise her to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day, Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost the entire hour.
I had just bought a new book book to <unk> and I had spent the whole morning with his many <unk> but then she was watching the empty space that goes after the words after <unk> please call <unk>
He was about to <unk> when he saw me and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I was <unk>
At that time, I got a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as I just worked with Alex as the 1950s.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> or a woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma which was <unk> from that crisis of identity and <unk> identity.
For identity capital I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of the career of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this: identity identity creates identity capital.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that should not count, which is not <unk>
It's <unk>
I told Emma who would explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I told Emma that the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> that come together with friends with the similar minds are limited to who you know, what you know, what you think about, how you think about, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who comes out of it almost always comes out of their circle later.
The new things come from what they call weak ties from friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak bonds are the way we <unk> this group.
Half the work created is never <unk> then to meet the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family when he has a partner and form her own family.
I told Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit that 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person you live now, or you get <unk> now when all on Facebook start walking towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that involves being so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just to do is to work or kill time with whoever you will give them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the fellow <unk> in a prime who worked at a art museum in another state.
This weak <unk> helped him get a job there.
That business supply was given for a reason to leave the boyfriend, who lived alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married one man who chose consciously <unk>
He <unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and he sent me a letter to me that said, "Now the spaces of attitudes, are not <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming from the airport in Los Angeles, which come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, by 21 or the 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here is my idea worth spreading to all the <unk> who heard of.
It's as simple as I learned to tell <unk>
This is what I have now the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> aren't the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity of identity -- using their weak ties to your family.
Don't let them define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They are deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job management for a work that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics at seventh grade in New York City public schools.
And as any professor, I held testing and tests.
I can give them tasks.
When the work came, <unk> grades.
What struck me was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had better performance didn't have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest children were going to be so good.
And that set me to think.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's <unk> but what if we succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn <unk> and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
We try to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> and we tried to predict what children to do as far possible in competition.
We studied teachers <unk> working in really difficult neighborhoods, and what teachers are still teaching for the end of the year and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the learning <unk>
We partnered with private companies, which of these vendors are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it emerged a feature as a significant success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look at the physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> passion and <unk> to achieve long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to his future, day after day, not just for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a long race.
A few years ago, I started to study the determination in public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my <unk> <unk> and then I waited around a year to see who they were <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination were significantly more likely to <unk> even when they <unk> them in every feature that I could measure, things like the family income, the results of <unk> testing -- even the safety that kids felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk for <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little the science knows about their development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How development will protect the children?
What should I do to teach children a solid job <unk>
How do I keep my motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals that just don't keep ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the <unk> is likely to be related or is still related to the action action.
Up until now, the best idea I've ever heard about developing <unk> is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University of Carol <unk> and is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and they grow in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we have to be successful and we have to be willing to fail, to start everything again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother, the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was inspired by this incredible language.
But for a abroad, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and fast method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five, I started to learn how to draw every single one of the strokes of every character in the right one.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than let's do it in a faster and simple.
A Chinese academic, <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy in it.
The first 200 will allow them to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read enough of the signals of traffic <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of the websites or the newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as you might be possible until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with their arms on both sides, as if I were screaming in a <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> the form of <unk> but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
<unk>
The moon.
The door symbol looks like a couple of doors in the <unk> <unk>
I call a <unk> to these eight characters.
These are building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old person, two are a crowd.
If one person stretch their arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a <unk> tree is quite an idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two <unk> it's very hot.
Three <unk> together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and light shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Get a board inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> got somebody at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they are <unk>
So we've already spent almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight <unk> will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build some other 32.
So with every little effort, you'll be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same thing that learns a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the <unk> sun.
This is a sun in the beginning, because Japan is in the east of China.
So one sun next to the beginning, create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
One Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains, stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where they go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and step back the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician <unk> together.
The film <unk> her imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave her a brilliant excuse to use a brilliant dress and lead a magic wand on.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of an industrial complex <unk>
However, the magician magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took rise for 40 years later to, interestingly enough, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> boy <unk> a girl dressed as a guard of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies we see today.
One is that there is very little violence in the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive -- like the <unk>
But I think if the Oz magician becomes today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the military generated by evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
The other thing from the magician magician is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did see "Star <unk> my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son of the child.
Two years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of <unk> had been <unk>  So he stayed in the room and was struck like a mom and he was impressed with her foot with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
He would have this feeling that Luke got an army to <unk> for government?
<unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How does it make Dorothy your movie?
We do good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up to them, right? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there as much consumer force to reach strength into the movies for our kids, and so little on the road of <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence movies in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by the experience that <unk> Princess don't provides the right framework that I had served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss.
My search is finished, I have a <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a stupid animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are lots of exceptions, and to stand up to the Disney of the Disney of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they, the guys, are not really their objective public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how they fight against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies for war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all times continues to spontaneously occur in classic after classic each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and her son, or two men who are raising a child.
So, as many of you are thinking, this year, eventually came out of <unk>
I recommend that to all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism was <unk> when it came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies passes the <unk> test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't just <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book <unk> and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that I had with a friend of mine on the movie evaluation you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be <unk> In the movie, there are more of a female character that has <unk>
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the kid who are so much like it?  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I really rarely see it in the cinema we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- an idea of consensus of what a Hollywood film movie.
<unk> doesn't happen the test test.
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen, a lot of the movie is happening in an embassy where men and women are hidden down during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful and painful conversation in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So I <unk> in numbers.
In 2011, in the 100 <unk> films how many of them believe they have actors <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently to Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a number of larger than this is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says that it has been sexually assaulted once in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
I also don't think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence, and then you charge the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to look at it.
We have tools to our willingness to be <unk> and we expect that to <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mostly the parents.
I think we have to show our kids a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the box, is radically changing.
You will have read about how the new economy is changing the role that looks after the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter who was his favorite Star favorite character from "Star <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What's in common these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that they know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them to achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories to tell my <unk> Go and fight and struggle and more stories where he looked like their work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and better be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things I liked was to look for the sea <unk> on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're sand covered and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was going to become <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of roughly 1,300 kilometers of length.
And my sea fever had grown the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew it had to look in another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place in the eastern <unk> of Egypt called <unk>
And the place of the naked eye, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process it using the <unk> of all a sudden the place looks like the <unk> <unk>
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the former Egyptian <unk>
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an ancient <unk> city called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Eastern about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Roman Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art and architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it's roughly about <unk> per square miles.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to the <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this one and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city in a <unk> <unk>
Trying to find the random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data from NASA to make a map, very subtle changes.
We could see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly <unk> area that looks inside the circle here, which we thought could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientific scientists doing <unk> jobs, you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like you take it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we're looking for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, under a solid layer of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation from the occupation of several hundred years ago that date back from the Middle Empire that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in jewelry of the Roman Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation coming back from the Middle Eastern in this place.
We also have evidence of a <unk> helicopter shop showing that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find it <unk> here, but we will <unk> to the place in a nearby future.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Roman Empire probably was written in <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on land.
So according to itself, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the idea really started in 1984 B.C.
It certainly puts the search of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door to <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now we have a bunch of obese <unk> group in bicycles.
They are racing in a fancy bike career and they go in address to their entrance door.
I need to look at this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they are <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying around and wheels that goes on on the side, <unk> of the wheels that end up in <unk> places, the threshold of the gate, <unk>
The <unk> in the hall, or what there is the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light. The light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that's speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> your tickle your tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you see it's about to get into the mouth.
<unk> on one side and trained their living room.
In the room, and making peak of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on your middle <unk> singing <unk> I <unk> One More <unk>
Now we go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow <unk> path of the oven.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition, which is conducted in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few men and a few different habits and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- looking at them just once.
They <unk> the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
I would add whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the quicker the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people need to be nature's phenomena.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This one is a man called Ed Cook, who had come from England and have one of the best memories in <unk>
And I asked him, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody who's involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous memory acts using some old techniques invented two years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives and the medieval <unk> used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, "How did I have no ear of this <unk>
We were standing outside the room of the competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful <unk> and <unk> although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards in national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up having the majority of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
It was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see what point our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in the back, he was a number of treaties on memory -- written something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time in which this idea of having a memory and <unk> disciplined and <unk> wasn't a thing as rare as you might like today.
A long time ago, people were investing in their memory, in providing <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they have also changed us.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they've changed us as well.
Because we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you're still passionate about this idea of a memory and <unk> disciplined and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are skills like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College College invited a group of memory <unk> to the lab.
They wanted to know, it will be that it has brains in some ways, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Is it more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a <unk> <unk> battery and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI machine, <unk> its brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in the memory champions -- they are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or they looked like a part of the brain that involves the space and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament is competitive is managing as a armed race where every year comes up with somebody with a new way of remembering more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must be put in a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he's about to try and memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and he was just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
It Yes.
And as there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used to ultimately reduce one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox <unk> <unk> says this: I say to two people who remember the same word, I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's her <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
So what do you <unk>
The person who said that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that's weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, it doesn't really mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
All the other memories dance in their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They were good when they come back home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when I <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some point back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this back two years ago, in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who went to a <unk>
They had hired me as a entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give a very good party, it didn't bring a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up, he <unk> his memory <unk> and he was <unk> and as soon as he was, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Let's get everyone.
But not only killed them all of all, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting.
So they could not get the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
<unk> stopped standing in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with his eyes in his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every time.
I took the family family <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What we had to pick up at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions by the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If I would tell you that I would tell you that the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to make them very likely to do it.
But I would bet that if you were to tell you to say who was sitting on the brown <unk> horse in his <unk> they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember -- the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the <unk> it will be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> of memory in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk, and you want to make it memory in the same way that I would have done it, if you had been invited to <unk> it was 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're in the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on <unk>
And that would tell you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how the speakers are <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word for word, which is going to confuse the typical <unk>
In fact, the term <unk> comes from Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people were thinking about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first would be like the first place in his <unk> <unk>
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got out of a full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an <unk> event.
Really, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting on taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone got to be <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in people's minds, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit on the New York Times simply trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was <unk>
I would never expect it to <unk>
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's really about to do is improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
And I was pretty excited about this.
This is me, using my standard <unk> team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a safety <unk> covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could sort of <unk> it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to <unk> and <unk> and phone numbers, and it is actually not the point.
These are just tricks.
Because they're based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it would be a <unk> <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
The most basic, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply <unk>
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make them <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them are not <unk> around.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, that's what I <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks our side will be so <unk> that we can't even afford to process <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capacities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we just <unk> just a <unk> place. New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> <unk> I was six years old, I lived there at home in my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the toilet, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there everybody was watching TV watching TV -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everyone was looking at me, and every time I came up with it, and I would come back up on a towel -- all of me.
And I was like this.
I was <unk> insecure and hated it.
<unk> that journey, hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and of areas of areas, but of those emotional connections that we feel about in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
So 90 percent of the time we're all around us with architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about -- you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know you think about it as well as based on a building built and a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> which is using architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection that we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we used it to build houses.
Look, these stable <unk> stable, in front of the sea, far away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building stuff is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the <unk> Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he's got this <unk> it has this round thing -- <unk> <unk> <unk> which <unk> what <unk> is about communicating with this <unk> the children, the property values -- the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library in today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, got another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come up, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so <unk>
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> architects that constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for today's living forms of life.
We would sort of push them together and we gave them so much, we get away from the people.
All of the black <unk> you think we think we feel very good, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go on the other side and get back to these symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started experimenting with <unk> we can swing the <unk> to go ahead and over and over again, so we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course it is in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, it was about the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Something really hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started to bring those symbols.
<unk> the <unk> in the other direction.
We take those shapes that we know that I like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added <unk> and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't take <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and made them in skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes are <unk> in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we move to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be the <unk> to the French, or the Italian <unk>
And perhaps with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They are easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we recreating context of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and we start to swing the <unk> again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we began to experiment with called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> now we have new <unk> design techniques -- and we find new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> -- one is totally <unk>
Normally, the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something else happened.
In 1997, the opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical and public and general in general, were completely dependent on a building.
The New York Times Times <unk> this building of <unk>
The tourism of Bilbao grows up a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild and <unk> how it is possible that they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those forms meant culture and <unk>
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The world's biggest mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and <unk>
This phenomenon of the new development happened with another star.
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to go through all the architecture.
Imagine, for example, how do you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years old, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight or 100 buildings more, before we know whether that I designed four years ago was a successful or not.
Because there's never been good feedback on architecture.
This is how we found ourselves with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement for 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen, because we're on the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to media, it starts to swing every time faster, until it will be on both extremes in both <unk> and it will effectively be the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the public.
We can now make more symbols and emotional burden of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a <unk> community.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community -- and as the drawings looked exactly at the right -- there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, is the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, you become part of your personal narrative, and that makes you <unk> with our collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks telling us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but that have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building has been built up today, first of the Internet searching for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, which can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell you that there's no unique response to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives it the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
Architects are no longer very mysterious creatures that use words and drawings and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> public who doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
Architects can listen, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> from one style to another movement, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different than the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick based on ideas of what it must be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve a sport or to <unk> or even you can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream in the East <unk> of New York City, and raise half a million dollars of the <unk> community around that cause, it's no longer a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what it matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make more <unk> and smarter buildings, more <unk>
We've been waiting for everybody to want.
Finally, we are no longer <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they give them a way to the most <unk> spaces of the local libraries the homes where we form our children, and the <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and already started walking.
And it does this great big way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do is look at the mirror.
She really loves his <unk>
It's <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom realize I used to do it. And it made me think, When did I stop doing this?
How is it that suddenly we're not comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, it just wants to be loved and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, because even though his mom tells him all the time she's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's <unk>
Between what his mom tells him and what his friends, or school <unk> they don't know who to believe.
So a video of her himself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he begs others who please leave a <unk> "I'm pretty <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received more than 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that I don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and ordinary healthy teenager, who receives these answers into one of the most vulnerable life of life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenagers trying to communicate this way.
But what is doing this?
Well, teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure pressure and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected in a continuous way, so young people are so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in your bedroom all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that goes from the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, to be always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they get.
There is no division between a online life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what it's authentic digitally.
What is the most important thing in people's lives, what is normal in a every day?
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news news now.
<unk> of <unk> keep dominating our <unk>
The <unk> technique is a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars of the sport, and the singers, <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, to the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other things begin to suffer.
Six out of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
These are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings, and how we can meet society and the labor of the labor development.
31 percent, almost one out of three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> <unk> to participate in the classroom <unk> because they don't want to call the attention for their physical form.
One in five are not attending classes at all day when they don't feel comfortable on it.
And in the rainy season, if you don't think you see good enough, specifically if you don't think you're thin, it will <unk> a note less to the average of your partners who don't care about that appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it turns out regardless of what these young people are.
So, to be good of course, we're talking about how you see you, not how you are.
The lowest self-esteem on its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-worth less physical activity, they eat fewer fruits and vegetables, participate in more diet not healthy that they can bring to a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by people around them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think that's all for what they make more <unk> decisions like consumption of alcohol and of drugs, diet aesthetic surgery, sexual activity, and without protection and harm damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether or they have no higher rates of <unk>
<unk> percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way they see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we were able to overcome this, what would that possibly look like?
We have this potential in interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, speaking, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> The first is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are lots of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children are still going to have a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six things are starting points for any willing to provide an education education that works.
An education is a <unk> but to address this problem requires every single one of us to take charge in the issue and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
We challenging the current status of as women are <unk> and I talked about our circles.
It's not good to count on our <unk> <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that the determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to begin to judge the people for what they are, not because they're seen.
All of us can start by making the responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions and not on their appearance.
And let me ask you to ask you: When was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, as governments and companies, to change our culture, so that our children will grow to valuing their whole person, valuing individuality, diversity, <unk> <unk>
We have to put the people who are really marking the difference in a <unk>
For making a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think you see that you can see that you are never going to be aware of being the ones that they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean to someone in their lives.
Who are you in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk>
It could just be the woman who's two seats away. What would it mean for her if he was liberated from that <unk> voice, in his interior, that he would <unk> it because he didn't have a long legs -- more <unk> <unk> feet more <unk> feet.
What would it mean for her if we were <unk> this and would lead to their potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is given us all together.
But we <unk> our kids the truth.
It tells you that the way you see you are just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because of how they do and how they make us feel.
<unk> to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
So let's switch every one of us, the way we talk about, and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year age today will become agents of sure themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On November five of the 1990s, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense <unk> <unk>
<unk> initially was <unk> but being a prisoner for other charges in the company, they began to plan attacks at about 12 <unk> of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N.
Fortunately, those plans was driven by an FBI informant in the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't be <unk>
He later <unk> it would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer who had a loving American, American mother, school School of the two did all of the potential for me to give me a happy childhood, by giving me a happy.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims -- they get to meet.
In experience I saw that when people take time to interact it doesn't need a lot to get to wish the same things in life.
However, in all of religion in all of the human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that thinks that we have to use all the means that they all lived like them.
A few months before he arrest him and he sat down with me and explained that in the last few weeks, he and some friends had been going to <unk> on Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go to the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on his shoulder and explained to me how to point to the goal at about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot her little orange light on the goal and, for a surprise of all, especially me, the whole goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned into the other and Arab <unk> he said, <unk> <unk>
As a father, as a child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter, but only a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to put it out with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot in the north Trade Center in the World Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I was 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability for my childhood, I was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to somebody was a <unk> moment and go to another city.
As I was always my face new of the class often was a <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white -- but it will be the new of the quiet class, silent and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons not developed social skills to say <unk> <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I was sent to kill people, based on <unk> <unk> like your race or your religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they started to test my way of thinking, was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the National <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the theme of juvenile violence, because I had been a <unk> <unk> almost my whole life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids we had ever <unk> was Jewish age.
I took several days out of the light, and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and I was really proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had been made me to believe was <unk>
Another crucial moment came up when I got a summer job in Bush -- <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was critical in the development of my character.
All of the life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
By the way, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critical than I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to deal with <unk> people exactly the way I wish to be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that was <unk> but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways he became my shape <unk> at a time where I was desperately <unk>
In occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected, and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to preserve my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who had suffered enough endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep that hatred inside you.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship to my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put into a potential risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone will be trying to get to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better path, that even though I joined this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, and for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
For the victims of the terrorism to speak against those <unk> acts, as rejection to the actions of my father.
And with this <unk> I put here as a proof of violence that violence is not inherent to any religion or <unk> that children don't have to follow the roads from their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Right now, there's a film that is projected in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk> film.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film, tastes and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger you pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of childhood that project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie are you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the mind of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths about being human.
Each one of us is conscious.
We all have a personal movie, you, you, you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least, I know I have an <unk>
I'm not sure that you're aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't conscious, anything in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> <unk>
Why are we not just <unk> robots that we get to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
<unk> by nature, is an objective that is an objective of nature.
<unk> by nature, is subjective subjective things.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because during most of the 20th century, we would <unk> that vision.
Now, psychology was studying <unk> behavior, neuroscience is the <unk> brain, but never mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that I introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of watching faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a rocket science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain types of mind, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of neuroscience work responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain are doing and what are they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
I don't <unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problem with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon, like <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how do you operate the <unk> how the <unk> are <unk> how <unk> are going to adapt and <unk> the living organisms, all are questions about how it works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and function of the human brain functions as a phenomenon of <unk> how we speak, how we talk about, how we speak, are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why it's all behavior accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, doesn't really have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> of heart.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works for a long time, hit the wall on the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end, I got to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we get <unk> at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanation, and we get used to this; the physics explains chemistry, the chemistry explains biology, the biology explains the psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea of our scientific worldview.
I think that consciousness, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate to our worldview, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that are <unk> crazy before you can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Their crazy idea is that there's no such good problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions, the behaviors of the brain, and this is what it needs to do all it needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and a lot of others, that vision is quite close to simply deny than the observation of consciousness is satisfying to be satisfying as a <unk>
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, space and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that are <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental properties and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything more basic.
On the contrary, they look fundamental as fundamental as the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, and then applied the basic laws of <unk> and applied the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, space, <unk> <unk> then the question of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be to do, is that as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick brick of nature.
That doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other core concepts space, the space -- the mass process.
<unk> sometimes say that we want fundamental laws that we can get them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws as simple as we can get them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everyone, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not just humans, the dogs the mice, the flies, even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of anxiety when you think, "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that the photons may have some kind of raw feeling, <unk> some early precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy, you know?
How did someone think that <unk>
In part this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's <unk> like space, the time and the dough, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to be <unk> it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind looks more like a continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that make thinking about the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Every time there's information processing -- there's awareness.
<unk> complex <unk> as in a human being, consciousness is complex.
<unk> of simple information, <unk> awareness.
Something that was very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, so I took this kind of theory and the developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And they're supposed to be able to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a middle degree of information, just as significant as <unk> <unk>
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness from zero.
It actually raises a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Furthermore, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't tell us about the reality that underlies us.
As explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be <unk> but they can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is what puts them in equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have a very serious ethical and ethical <unk>
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that has consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hunger.
I think by thinking about this, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms, and <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask by consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has an complicated data processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a pretty serious ethical problem about the ethics of the development of smart computers and the ethical of <unk>
Finally, you can ask by the collective collective consciousness that's the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or to a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk, at this point, we have a TED collective consciousness, a internal movie for this full group of TED, different from the inner movies in every single <unk>
I don't know the question, but I think at least it's a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually safer from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is something fundamental -- that from second to be universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we're finally going to be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small village in rural Victoria.
I had a very normal profile. It had an profile of education.
I went to school, I joined my friends, <unk> my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because he wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice but there's a secret problem.
She didn't get <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, had good notes. After school, I had a underwater profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, yes. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of the teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class, and I had a guy raised the hand and said, "Hey, when do you get your <unk>
I said, "What a <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for some good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in lawn chairs talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this child had had a experiences with disabled people as objects of inspiration.
And we don't are. And it's not the fault of the boy, it is, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire me.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you. Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid of <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you've been lied to disability.
Yes, you have been sold that disability is something called a <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you phenomenal <unk>
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you fantastic <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl with no hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with <unk> <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk>
And I use the <unk> <unk> term because they <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we tend to have the disabled disabled benefit of people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life could be worse.
I could be that <unk>
But if you are that person?
I've lost track of the number of times that have been <unk> <unk> to say that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this would happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I got up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attached to people with disability in profit from people with no disability.
You're there so that you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
So let's make some things.
But the things that we don't have is the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I joined the so-called social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more connected because of the society that we live in due to our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
The things I need to do, and I've learned to pull out the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it like a compliment.
And I know why that happens.
It's because of the lie. Because we have been sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> aren't sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> other people with disability at all time.
However, I didn't know that I'm lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to upload your mobile phone battery in your <unk>
Great.
We learn from force and resistance.
I really believe that that lie that they've sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in a distance of stairs has not made a <unk>
Never.   <unk> in front of a television screen, not going to show the <unk> for people to <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude to the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered to be <unk> nothing for being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have that low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> to stand up from bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine accomplishment of <unk> and I want to live in a world where a kid at 11 grade in Melbourne is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think you know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I just answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow them to experience what is a professional <unk> in the countryside.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will engage with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what it is to run by the game of play with 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds <unk> us trying to stick with all of it.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So I put some videos to show you what the Google would be <unk> under the hull, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images from the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of the emerging technology is a submarine going up to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
A moment. Let's get a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that you need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue <unk> Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the sensation being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be their favorite players and asked me in YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go to <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which you certainly know about.
The Rift Valley has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why that with this video.
Man: Oh.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a rollercoaster <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you take a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> throwing the ball to the bottom of the network?  Or I was <unk> by doing a <unk> in <unk>
What will be their experience as a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of <unk> for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk> reality.
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when the <unk> and the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a quick review of the technology in the <unk>
In <unk> the Baltimore of Baltimore had a <unk> to his field <unk> so that he would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other people decided to do this.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> of the field <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player going back to your group, and you see her next move in front of you, in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have in front of you -- you don't have to worry about having a <unk>
He has to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate <unk>
If you lose parties -- you might be a coach.
And they don't want that.
But the augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to gather information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that's down.
You also get information from the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know about it.
The bad guys will have information <unk>
This is <unk> the good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer equipment will be as important as your <unk> and the analysis of data will stop being just for <unk>
It will be for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that they're the field.
<unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> to a open receptor -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left part of your bombsight.
It <unk> the area of protection.
Another <unk> would you <unk> that there's an open <unk>
<unk> the <unk> but they <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, however, you see the receptor and an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> running and <unk>
The public is really <unk> and the fans have continued to move it from every angle.
This is something to create massive emotion on the game.
I'm going to make you lots of people -- because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the countryside, right?
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, you want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We are going to use it as a bread and <unk> like our entertainment <unk>
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, be somewhere else.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth of a teacher trying to show a <unk> how bad it is their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how to be <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> or a Neil <unk> Neil <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes close.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service on the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years old, the <unk> <unk> the southern end of <unk> County includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known by its beautiful <unk> of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the world's most used places.
The Golden Gate bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who had been able to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much to test <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers taking them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that the fall of it frees you out of all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a free <unk> to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bones, some of which we make life organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The ones that don't normally get in the <unk> water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that you know, this <unk> method will realize the death <unk> <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to take their life.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is on that edge, and at its darkest time, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young woman was talking with a official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today officers, officials are trained to the new land.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at 22, last year to get a call from a potential suicide <unk> sitting on the <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, I saw Jason talking to an official the Golden Gate bridge.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up to here two times before New Jersey to try and kill them from this bridge.
After about a time talking to <unk> we asked ourselves, if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity was able to get the <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on to the right, and he left.
This kind of kind and clever and New Jersey and I had just taken her life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason had the <unk>
<unk> fall out of suicide affect a lot of people.
I ask these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What a <unk>
<unk> what that <unk>
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you have to listen in my own <unk>
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like this, because you probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have you thought about your life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they never go to <unk> <unk> to believe that there's nothing you can do to the <unk> isolation, social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost his son on January 19, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he is with his permission and blessing who read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing noticing that Mike won't come home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> <unk> with his father on the 19th of January.
It never came there.
He called the police of <unk> and they <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and told me that the <unk> car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jumping from the bridge to the <unk> in the late day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before without getting a true mental illness.
It shouldn't be that easy to end with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean by hope and value.
On March 11 2005, I went to a radio call for a <unk> subject on the sidewalk of the bridge near the north.
I was going down the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the hour and a half later, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to tell that day back to that lane and give life another chance.
When I was Kevin <unk> I <unk>
This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he made him <unk> and gave her life to hope and the other <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
You stopped talking to me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the <unk> events and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We give him to God for you.
<unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she wrote, <unk> When I visited the General <unk> San Francisco at that night, you will <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and active member of society.
He speaks openly about the events of that day and of their depression that their story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of their own pain, theft the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want its own pain <unk>
Usually this is only achieved by three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls of suicide around the bridge.
So those incidents I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
For that time, I got my hand at three times.
At the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> sorry, but I have to go."
And they <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one who leaves the railing realized that they had made a mistake, and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge not only connects to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or a bridge that we do, is something that everybody and every one of us must be striving to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but in your inside, you know what you are, and a question asks you, how do you tell you in that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I felt eventually I had a dream that I had since I had since I had ever been.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner one.
So for reasons, I'm going to go back later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that I am just starting.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the color of the skin or the beliefs of those of us around us.
These are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- my <unk> even ignored my story.
I think this enigma is called epiphany.
This is mine.
I was exposed to being born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt in the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why is that <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair.
I knew how to <unk>
The gender has always considered a <unk> but now we know that, actually, it's more complex and mystery <unk>
Because of my success, I never helped me share my story, not because it thought that I am a bad thing, but because of how the world deals with those of us who want to <unk>
Every day grateful to be a woman.
I have mom and dad and a family who is just accepting me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist <unk> of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines of these puzzles.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me. This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the CEO of a beauty of beauty.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you involved in the <unk>
He told me that if she got to <unk> she was responsible for the <unk> and <unk> and that night, he won in <unk> I won in <unk> and he was a third <unk> among more than 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of <unk>
Not many people can say that their first work was <unk> of beauty of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you give you to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was stuck in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand to perform the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before the name was before we changed the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name <unk> and the gender <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity paper means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears became <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be a model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was <unk> she lived his truth, but he said, <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 November, we make a global <unk> for the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people that <unk> and stood in the injustice.
These are inappropriate P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth alone and just to me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, nor fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there are no longer any more <unk> than 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Yeah. <unk> first, thank you all my <unk>
My parents from support to my parents especially, in my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women who have <unk> young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they called me and told me that their parents couldn't take it, I would take the phone, and he said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- others don't. It's just gender identity -- that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everybody assigned us a gender to birth, and what I try to do is put on the table that sometimes that task was not a block and there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. <unk> <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, the parents generally know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when their efforts would <unk> the efforts in 2011, by <unk> the National Prize <unk> became very popular in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of the inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the very beginning, when at birth a little girl, their birth doesn't <unk>
It's not welcome, not by your father, or your mother.
The neighborhood comes in, day your <unk> to the mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot to be a lot of a child.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first child, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a child, when she <unk> his third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the mother suffering, but the daughter. The daughter just <unk> when it grows, he suffers as well.
When I should go to school, when I should go to school, you stay home and school admits of their siblings.
Up to the age of 12 years, in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move on the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes into age 13 years old, he <unk> her home without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes a so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if he <unk> the code of that <unk> <unk> it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption code, not just the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and her sisters in the name of the course of honor.
And there's a rule of <unk> societies called <unk>
One good girl is supposed to be very <unk> and very <unk>
That's the best.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepting the decisions of their father and their mother and the choices of the elderly -- even if they don't want to.
If you <unk> it with a man who doesn't like it, or if the <unk> with an old man has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the very young <unk> really has to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens in the end?
In words of a <unk> <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson for her children.
And this vicious circle goes on and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And a lot before I <unk> I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> from <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she was there, when she was four and a half years old, the <unk> in my school.
Can you be wondering, why should I mention the <unk> of a <unk>
Yeah, I must <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies <unk> in tribal societies that is a great event for a young girl.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
One applied to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I was <unk> the form of <unk> Canadian and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for the value of my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters not to his daughters, I thought he had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged <unk> to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just to <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and girls alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, will forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we have a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation of women in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have these people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10, <unk> got up and got up on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog of the BBC, he was offered herself for the New York Times documentaries and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and nine from October 2012, he was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he <unk> him to my wife and <unk> <unk> so I spent my daughter, <unk>
And he said, "Please, please don't <unk>
<unk> the right cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, and because of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get <unk>
Both of them were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words were going to spend a lot for me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I <unk> I was in the hospital and I had severe pains and strong headaches from my head because your facial <unk> was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my <unk> smile, and with my face.
I'm going to be fine. Please do not <unk>
It was a solace for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when he doesn't just have his homework.
They fight their siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's special in my <unk> which has made so bold to <unk> so brave, expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> I didn't do.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I am engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I talk about today about brain science, I did before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma when you give a brain operation.
Are you still as smart or not?
If you're not going to be like that, you'll be able to become intelligent again.
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to make, from over a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if it didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations of chemicals, and mix them out of chemicals, and try to <unk> them to keep alive.
I even saved myself for a little bit.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would try to get them out of the <unk> doses that really doesn't have a map of which I say in <unk>
I started to test a little mix of <unk> and I was amazed at seeing how little changes in the <unk> dose, is dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I was, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and chemists typical and chemical chemicals for a <unk> man, and I was surprised to see how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of the <unk>
It turned out as an end.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit of <unk> fixing a problem that had on the front, and it just didn't happen.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and what they have to do, and I've been better with men.
What I was trying to do is I could adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, and I was reclaim my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my creative flow of ideas.
It became almost always in images, and that became my key reference point -- how do you get these mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you are <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things differently.
They thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing.
There are those who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how minds work, for me it's simple: to most of us, mental imaging are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I was able to find the right point, and I have already lots of great mental <unk> it really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images from my mind to the screen of the computer.
Can you imagine what if a movie director was able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were made by two groups leading in neuroscience.
They both used technology, MRI imaging to represent the brain here, and you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of a person who looks at an image.
The spinal cord shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual as you <unk> to see that same image.
The column on the right is created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into the visual <unk>
Let's go back this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains in order to create a huge array of feedback from the brain in front of the video.
And then you showed you a film with new images, new animals, new animals, and as long as you would have a new <unk>
The computer using just the brain information from the scanning of the scanning of the scanning of what seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're okay to do that.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the brain scanning brain scanning systems available today, and its resolution only increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we <unk>
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull, and you electrodes.
I can't offer me that.
Many are proposing new projection techniques by imagery, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- we should first ask, the next technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, more <unk> magnets just give small improvements in the resolution, not by thousands of them as we need.
I propose this idea, instead of larger magnets make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with <unk> slightly different <unk> like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort in the MRI was to make big, big magnets right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> and brilliant solutions in <unk> and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> of FM provides in MRI systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field, <unk> magnetic patterns structured and <unk> <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio frequencies -- we can increase in a massive form of the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split into layers our growing knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid -- but the hormones and <unk> that I've mentioned and perhaps even neural neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to <unk> our ideas directly.
Can you imagine if we could pass on top of the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be <unk> as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few options more than opening this door.
So anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet probably to say to some person for the first time that he love, or telling somebody who's pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other conversation that you have to do for you in life.
It's all closet a tough conversation is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet a universal thing.
It's fear, and we don't like to happen.
Many years ago, I was working on the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through various stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> -- my armpits, not <unk> my armpits, <unk> <unk> <unk> like a <unk>
And I will be <unk> that by the <unk> of my <unk> <unk> and I had my head <unk> I was usually asked by a kid to say, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would appear uncomfortable at the table.
I <unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper, the mother tossed a cold look at his son.
But I would never say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a boy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to come into the women's issues on the table --  I had the Betty <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a clip from the "Vagina Monologues" I <unk>
So I took a breath down and I went down and on my back, a four-year-old girl with a pink, and looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a girl or <unk>
So I took a step back, again, I got <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is <unk>
I have the short hair like the one of a boy, and I saw <unk> but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
I am more than a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it, just "Ah, <unk> You're a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both we were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and I know, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know how color the walls.
You just know how it feels like living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from you or your yours or yours.
I will give you 100 reasons why I get out of my closet that was harder to come out of work, but this is the <unk> The <unk> is hard to be <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to someone who have declared bank <unk> is harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder to tell your son five years old than you are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop <unk> what is hard to do with respect to what hard to someone else to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to only feel empathy because we all live a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I had a horse <unk> a dress and <unk> <unk>
It wasn't the militant lesbian who was not ready to fight any <unk> he would put in the coffee.
It was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my ideal <unk> my gay grenade and the moving only muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full of strangers that I've spent my whole life trying not to <unk> and now the world turned around to purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all been followed by so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill you.
One of my most memorable launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and when I do my <unk> <unk> and I walked around the tables and I finally walked around the tables and finally arrived around the tables and finally came to one where my parents, people I knew I knew about years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women cried to <unk> <unk>
And the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and has never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite, <unk> and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in hopes to show desperately your support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt, <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you do.
That's how hard conversations are still my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves getting out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others must be able to do that we too.
Number two: Be direct <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and most important --  Let the complex guys.
You communicate their truth.
It would never be influenced by that.
And some of them can come out of safe hurt by what they've done, but they never am sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very themselves, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If we look at the story of how the intelligence has seen a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism to the computer pioneers as Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I <unk> a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's take a walk.
First we start with a thought experiment.
Imagine that you are from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth and the neuroscience of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but you have incredible telescopes, and you can see that have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as a <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from an alien race that doesn't know about it, that doesn't have any concept of intelligence on Earth, you would see it forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until some time in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through several disciplines, that I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be successfully executed for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for development of universal states that we prescribe the diversity of future future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic motion, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the robots of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I asked, from a few years ago, there is a mechanism underlying the intelligence that we could extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence I've ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is such a strength, <unk> that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open choices with a force T, with the diversity of possible <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
<unk> is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keeping open options.
And so, in account of this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> it is?
<unk> the human intelligence level.
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> some research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> in their life should be a tendency to be more favorable condition for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence <unk> a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of the long-term entropy production, but actually arises directly from it?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> which is designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where we encounter inside.
<unk> <unk> was able to spend multiple animal testing, playing human games, and even winning money -- actions, and all of it without the fact that we had to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Like a human standing human, here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it to <unk> a goal.
He just decided for his own balance to balance <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for <unk> <unk> and human care.
This ability for tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, the same as some other animals can cooperate throwing on opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can actually perform a version of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
Here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and holds the network right now.
This same <unk> capacity of network also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a boats, and we found successful and using the Panama Panama to extend globally.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in terms of defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a <unk> strategy in a <unk> series of actions, to successfully increase assets by asset management exponentially.
This risk risk is going to have vast applications in finance, and in sure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term use -- the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if we were <unk> intelligent machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, going on.
The machines become <unk>
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had all the concept of <unk> rebellion, in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They ask me, how do they look for targets we learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go through the descendants of how to help them build artificial artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, it's the following.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, over the last few years, we've extended our knowledge of how the Earth fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Bureau of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points out to the Earth is only one among the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the dim <unk> of the stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light coming back.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there are between them and their mother's star.
Together, this helps us to understand if these planets are small, <unk> like the Earth planets from our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their suns.
Instead, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The hottest year was the hottest year recorded.
<unk> and ice ice that have been with us for millennia, now are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've made on a global scale have rapidly <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist in the weather, or <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet being influenced by the stars, hoping to find places in the universe where we find life beyond our planet.
I could say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the pursuit of life in the universe I can tell you that the more look for planets like the Earth -- more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better: our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world to be demonstrated by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past and partly that we study both to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> track their surface into search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
<unk> satellites like the <unk> mission take samples of the atmosphere and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
<unk> companies are now providing not just short space flights but also the potential <unk> of living on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still have for <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and <unk> places on Earth is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets will become a great and sad <unk> the implication and the belief that Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly livable the Earth.
For a lot I like the <unk> exploration, I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is like figuring that the captain of the Titanic will say that the party of the truth will go later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration exploration, and the land preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They are closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with an experiment that was <unk> the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, "I thought our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider between the stars, to lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that are going to develop this development.
It's kind of <unk> to think that only the colonization will save us ourselves, but we have the planetary exploration and exploration exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the even easier task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I <unk> my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window in the dining table, where I had <unk>
So quickly he tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all right.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and I <unk> my passport and my suitcase together.
<unk> expensive, but sure that not more expensive than a <unk> at the middle of the day, so I thought, well even though the circumstances would be <unk>
I am a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate -- <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I came to the counter counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in place that would have happened bad stuff.
Or at least, if bad things happen, they will <unk> the likelihood that it's a total catastrophe on it.
So I started thinking about that, but until one month later, my thoughts would not happen.
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> who's been the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he talked about the window, and he had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that you could go wrong, then you try to figure out what it can do to prevent things or to prevent the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious things.
At the house, they <unk> a place for things that are <unk>
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space does.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of the important things, where the good, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the <unk> trees live, where tribes are friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They not used the smell, but the hippocampus, that mechanism very evolved in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys in the car, reading <unk>
So at home we put a place for the keys, a hook alongside the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular drawer for you.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and you are <unk> with it, your things will always be there when you get them.
What about the <unk>
Take a picture of your credit card, stop driving, you get <unk> by email themselves so that you're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that underground.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation that when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved way, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talking about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of the medical decisions, and in fact for decision-making and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take from which we would benefit an rational assessment of the facts.
So let's suppose you go to the physician and the doctor says, "I got the outcome of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with greater risk of <unk> disease, heart <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even if you are likely to know the people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should ask for which most doctors don't want to speak, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you should think of what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor would not give me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's <unk> it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But <unk> estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work only about 30 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> most widely wondering what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of researchers cynical and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a single heart attack, or a brain <unk> or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, a little probability on 300 of my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you should ask for one more statistic and it is, <unk> of the <unk> <unk> Yes?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in the five percent of the patients.
And those include things <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The Five percent is not quite likely to happen to me, still to take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how you look at this, so that you don't have to make the chain of thinking on the act.
300 people are taking a drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 -- they have side effects, that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug that will help you the drug.
I don't say you should not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic has it required, is part of the early informed consent principle.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to try is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the older men from 50 percent of prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
So it's 49 surgeries by a person who has <unk>
And the side effects of that case are produced in 50 percent of patients.
Those include the <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of time before the questions that you can argue to be the conversation going forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a lot of a <unk> a lot of times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have much pain in the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face 2 <unk> <unk> you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or your immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism on those things, it's not rapidly <unk> to be lunch for the lions, so nothing matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go through the window during those moments of stress is rational thought like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to <unk> to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help you minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I entered the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor developed a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the gate of the gate in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters I haven't ordered and lots of messages I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing from a <unk> tree there, you see it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be never <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> plus a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the intervening decade of time, and at the time of time, it was mixed with local signs, and it was developed the language we know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years old.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, really, are in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, who lives in a sound world, is like I lived in a foreign country, following <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do you understand the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can make sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've ever learned, for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the <unk> <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, you make sure you're not <unk> the <unk> in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag on what the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting for the sound, which is about coming next.
There this drawing.
<unk>
It was going to be <unk>
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, <unk> to be with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and <unk> spaces, and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my art in art.
Is it going to be more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know that well that it's not only experienced through the ears.
I can feel this <unk> or experience it visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound ownership and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me about the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, the power, the <unk> social currency.
In the background of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a <unk>
And sound is so powerful that I could be able to <unk> myself and my artistic work, or I could help me.
I chose to be <unk>
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me and to become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, the work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> his voices, I am able to keep a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan out of a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could focus on the <unk> and you don't have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic environment, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't capture and expressing on the paper.
And the same thing can be said for a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the things as both of the signs as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you can understand how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in many different <unk>
If you <unk> a different <unk> for every finger, as you play the piano, the facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand and so, while you play the piano, English is a linear language, as if you <unk> just a key at a time.
However, <unk> is more like a chord, you need 10 fingers to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If just a key <unk> it would change the chord, create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of <unk> <unk>
In <unk> when you use these different parameters <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk>
This is the <unk> sign in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started to think, and if I look at <unk> through <unk> <unk>
If I had to create a sign and you put it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all the day."
If you <unk> it and <unk> the visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
Every day.
I feel that the same can be said to <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents what time is expressed in <unk> and how much the body distance can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and dramatic at the time, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times by <unk>
But when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Watch <unk> hand, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of the hand called <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
Everybody with the <unk>
Now we're going to do it both in your head as your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, pretty good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please drive it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all occur in the head and the chest -- but they make very different meanings with it.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and <unk> just like the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't sound automatically -- it doesn't have social value.
We have to begin to question what defines social value and allow <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And perhaps people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> I don't have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a rich treasure. I would like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in your culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents told me, "Can you get it all up, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble bubble -- I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning each other.
The time is now an adult and teaching citizenship and invention in school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait so much for my students to walk on the beach with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if you are, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of scary.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, and we are networks, and we can collect those pieces of plastic to come up under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive, and it's also very risky to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, with ages of six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We have transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that the very <unk> children can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids who manipulate power tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to the plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce the size of the size we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to convince them in something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the kids would be <unk>
Then we actually create what we call "a <unk>
We are so quick in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned out light and web cameras, and they <unk> it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer computer process is able to process this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get a different estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would push it even further.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
You see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it gets <unk> with this image:
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands of the world in <unk> the largest <unk> rainforest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the mud and the oil is also brown color, and when all the <unk> is really hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> which can <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> what can help to identify what's in the water.
They had this prototype with a sensor and we send it Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help the other children.
I was forced to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started a lot of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> flew several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in an instant.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power station near the water.
And today, as an average of 300 tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West Coast, we can measure ultraviolet radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and the most part, the most part, it looks safe and it's blue.
Well, it's actually a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and researching independent with other scientists, the land, the river, and we wanted to bring the children.
Of course not the <unk> parents don't <unk>
But every night you go to the center of the <unk> here you see the use of different <unk>
It might seem like they didn't take their seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> their whole life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region about the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this we were able to notice that the radioactive dust gets <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> and <unk> system in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition, the nearest <unk> to the date.
We get closer to a half miles of the nuclear power, and with the fishermen of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a <unk> <unk> as we have we invent and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem.
And it has been very exciting to work on these different scales, also open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became so small, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and convert it into larger space, dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry -- a little bit of biology, of <unk> basically, you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where kids of kids can actually become reality with adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
So for example.
Or can we help in mobility of the elderly population transforming their standard wheelchair chairs in new vehicles.
<unk> oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizen scientists, creators, we need to prepare the next generation to be worried about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other one of a silk thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic stuff.
One is placed on the environment, the other thing believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for her.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool for Michelangelo.
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> from different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The <unk> of the back are <unk> with little <unk>
You act primarily as a filter, the other mainly as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that shapes its functionality through <unk> variation.
Here's a divided screen that represents my vision of the world -- the <unk> personality of every designer and architect to work on between the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, and <unk> shows up on the two screens behind me.
My work on its simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, from moving from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourself, why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where four disciplines that offers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and my students' hands.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scale, scale, like this robotic arm with an <unk> of 24 meters in diameter with a <unk> base that one day is not very far to print <unk> and graphics and nanoscale <unk> made from genetically engineered <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every aperture is <unk> to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion <unk> with <unk> van <unk> It's like a second skin made out of one piece, <unk> in flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with <unk> 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> and I'm going to show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> <unk>
That designers have access to this high resolution <unk> and the instruments are able to design products that are <unk> not just the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic <unk> a chair at the very comfortable structural chair, and it also absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator came back to nature for <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
It <unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, shape its functionality not by the addition of other material or another <unk> but continuously continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what I care about.
Like her <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends it to Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first <unk> tree, there would be no difference between trunk, including leaves and <unk>
The tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made trees growing trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if the objects made a single part?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we looked for the material to <unk> the kind of material in the tree <unk> and we found it.
The second <unk> the most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune into their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  We asked a lot of <unk> <unk> the <unk> and produced <unk>
We replaced the chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> into the light, soft and transparent.
To print out the large-scale structures that was built in a system with multiple <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the material properties of the march and create these structures made of one half a half <unk> <unk>
When the pieces are ready, it leaves them dry in order to find a natural form in the contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process is used to contain <unk> <unk> that first appeared on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria genetically engineered in the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> <unk> and if it <unk> even more to windows.
A <unk> <unk> <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects designed to <unk> they put the <unk> <unk> life and placed on the ground, help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration use of the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control its flow.
Just like the <unk> <unk> we made our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> <unk> new basic basic features within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
You turn it into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like a <unk> <unk> that will help you <unk> these bacteria and that they <unk> their function <unk>
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material as the functionality is <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> channels more transparent.
This system <unk> <unk> when you stretch away from one end to another minus 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times as much as our own gut <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels in life within the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are working creatures -- it's only half a half <unk>
What if the design would give the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, and we <unk> the harmed and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home in which they were <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, <unk> those fibers together.
And this goes through scales.
The silk worm is happening in the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, is shown in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a tiny magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with synthetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that you would <unk> a <unk> plane and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different regions different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape -- the composition of the <unk> was transmitted directly by the environment.
It was often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and it is used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates is able to shape raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> doing <unk> and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that silk worms will be in dark and <unk> and so we used a solar system diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat it into the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We wanted to <unk> silk <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is great integrity, and he was right.
Al <unk> biological silk is given the entire pavilion and their integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry -- this is also the length of the silk <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> by a robotic arm, the other full <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form a material ecology -- designers should bring these two visions of the world.
Which leads to a turn, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of the creation, that brings us from a design inspired by nature to an inspired nature of design, which requires us, for the first time that we make in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were asked when they asked them for the first time.
They can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and developing websites -- I was able to find the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard of us.
And they usually like to try and persist in every rate, because I have dedicated a long time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I was struck by something else, something totally different, and I got stuck in it, and I get <unk> and I feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it back.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all my other passions and <unk> <unk>
Another reason that made me so much anxiety was a little bit more <unk>
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me not <unk> at all.
I was concerned about being afraid of engagement, or to be dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to ask you then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you do it, learned from the culture.
First question: "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what we're going to do at that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause cute answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is about and again as we grow in different forms, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before it takes us sleep.
Why?
If this thing is inspired by the kids to dream with what they might be, not inspired to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, but even though adults can be <unk> you may be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of the destination or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do for their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and to dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up their curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feeling there is something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with lots of interests and creative activities.
It's a breath that I say.
It could help you if you divide in three <unk> multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the Renaissance of the Renaissance, the ideal was a <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> whatever term you like or your own <unk>
It looks like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or <unk> that you should win.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths going into this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests on cartography, visualization visualization, mathematics and design and design found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry.
<unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of this unique idea of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
So the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is learning learning.
When the <unk> are <unk> we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means we're less afraid to try new things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> full-time <unk> and <unk>
As a girl <unk> an incredible capacity to develop memory memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before he became a writer, he was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the highest sales mechanics when he was starting their practices and this ability to write a very compelling launches for the editors.
It's rarely a waste of time to go to what you're going to ask you, even if at the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. It is to say, the ability to transform whatever you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of the videos, and a phone designer, sometimes a <unk> <unk> sometimes a teacher, sometimes a teacher, sometimes James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> Company Magazine defines the most important ability for development, to flourish in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be <unk> to meet the needs of the market needs that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three abilities that you could lose if you're <unk> to reduce your goals.
As a society, we have a lot of interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, we have <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> <unk> knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams have come from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The bat can dive into depth and put ideas in practice, and <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all should have to design lives and careers that will <unk> how we are connected.
And, unfortunately, to the <unk> most of them are being told by being more like their fellow <unk>
I once said that, if there is one thing that you will take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner wiring -- whatever it is.
If you are a heart, then you go through all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with his many passions.
Keep your curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads us to a <unk> and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we <unk> a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for unfortunately, passed away from <unk>
After his death, she did a <unk> and found weird <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you were going to have been living today, we could not give her more help than the <unk> she gave him a <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine.
You have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer <unk> <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But a little bit of progress has been influenced by Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it'll affect 150 million which, by the way, include many of you.
If you expect to live up to the 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of the two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that they spend their years from Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or helping care of a friend or to be dear to Alzheimer's disease.
In the United States alone, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spending due to Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs -- a <unk> increase in 2050, as the generation of the <unk> generation gets older.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the major medical challenges and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively <unk> for <unk>
Today, one of the world's first causes of death worldwide, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than we do because we spend less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's despite the fact that we are more due to Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but the whole world -- Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all the scientists, the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think that we will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you just have to look at a picture of a normal brain brain, compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain is caused by Alzheimer's reduces significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the <unk> brain, a century ago.
For nearly a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds up like an origami.
There are places on the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> dots end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots are left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can make big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we would do, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of the wires have been lowered and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, biologists, <unk> and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened to the test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have the protein molecules that stick to each other within them, as in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live in a normal life.
This is just a positive <unk> but research as this shows Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years old, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so that it grows that hope, from overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince ourselves that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we <unk> it can be <unk>
In the case of other conditions, the patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, industry.
That was essential to advance the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit of overcoming cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for the change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that cannot create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help demand for a cure.
Thank you.
I <unk> this article in the New York Times <unk> in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, they do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to test it myself one night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers are <unk> to make more and more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions for example.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would that be?
Number one: When was the last time you ever <unk> another person?
And they <unk>
The <unk> <unk> these are every personal time.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me, <unk> your partner what you like it or I like to do, and I make things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a really detail really struck me the attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to be <unk>
But I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the Love column a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it is already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably wondering: follow them together.
And the reason I think you think about this is because I've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before the paper was published, the paper was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had helped me write about my experience in the romantic love in my blog.
But a blog <unk> can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just of my Facebook friends, and I imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand of them.
And that came up with a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The paper was published on Friday at night, and the Saturday Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I had already called the "Today Show and Good <unk>
In a month, the paper was got over eight million <unk> and I was, to say something, I was just ready for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing <unk> about own <unk> experience, but something else is to discover that loving loving life has been an international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or <unk> what they did for every day for weeks, they were doing the same question: do they have still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase: <unk> <unk>
And various messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
I actually gave a talk, and a woman stands up to the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And immediately I got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not ready for the wingspan of the answer.
36 questions seemed to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for St. <unk> that included the experiences of readers when I test the study in different degrees of success.
So, my first urge to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and I <unk> the orders of pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process, a range of that I didn't feel like at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know whether they really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce <unk> love, not just an adventure, but real love, <unk> love.
But this was a question I wasn't able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, above all, that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know whether you <unk> together or not, and you also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for encouraging <unk> between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
<unk> felt closer to doing that, after several later studies, they also used the <unk> <unk> protocol as a way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They have been used among members of the police and the community and they've used it to be used among people of <unk> policies.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, and we combine personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, it was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little <unk> arts university and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you get rid of the person who <unk>
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but they got better friends?
<unk> that I do have gotten better better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult separation of it.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I was experimenting with science.
I did all of the things that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that would somehow be <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just ran for the book I wrote but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought if I was excited about the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I felt like I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one or other way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand what I did.
But I can also see me most clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is more than what you can do is sometimes more of what you can demand for me.
What I'm looking for of love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be <unk> out of the person I love you.
It may be that the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media was told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because fall in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we are very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story version that the story is, still together?
And the content with a <unk> answer, or No.
So more than a question, let's ask ourselves to do harder questions like, "How do you decide who deserves your love, and who doesn't?
How will I stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love somebody.
So, if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, and I applied a study that was designed to create romantic love, we are still <unk> and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love with not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
<unk> <unk> because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit to read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I hadn't considered everything that that choice was supposed to be.
I didn't think we would have both of them to take that decision, and how much times will I have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always chose or not.
I want you enough to have done and responded to 36 questions, I have chosen to love someone so generous, kind and fun and expressed that choice in the largest daily <unk>
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really know.
And what I <unk> and what maybe spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is a chance to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's a deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a <unk> <unk> and in a way, I got like a forest <unk>
The city of New York takes a time --  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
He took a box of wood, and he <unk> a dollar, a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some of the <unk> and some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's got fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from tour and <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages from a <unk> <unk> style into Agnes Martin, the <unk> and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking it could be <unk>
Instead, it happened, in some way it seemed to grow as size, as if it was that they would <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did -- I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs, strange bottles that I was finding out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow out to draw the same thing around a dead body in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of <unk> <unk>
First of all, I think you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibits and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with pictures of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on glass layers, similar to the drawing in a window, then on another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together formed a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something really big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> garden of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
<unk> feet long.
It's twice a face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals are traveled between two worlds.
You're going from the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> <unk> where you <unk>
This is where creatures with animals are headed by <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird God tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
So it's also kind of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and spits out oil on a hand while the other hand comes out of clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit a narrative.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird, and spits out of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail, a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turn into the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why I did that.
Things that go, you know.
Your tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> made of terrorists in 1986.
They've been <unk>
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> at his time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material or <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of a human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 to 12 at a time.
They're like cells, they come together, they are <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years old.
Each one is basically a microscope layer that weighs 1,300 pounds of a human being trapped inside of it.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can get the entrance to <unk>
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of your chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't hold it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and go into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes that we live in.
We are in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician a musician a musician -- a <unk> a <unk> a museum, a <unk> an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
They <unk> the box and all the people in it hits each other as particles.
And I think that's how we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that is living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very facts from the same stuff and in the same box.
And if we don't start trading those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have the pain, first goes through the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
Take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system for any <unk> drug in the body.
The <unk> though, is that by <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are going to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase your blood cells.
But they are also known for their side side effects, in their majority of negative effects, because in the time that it takes to get to the <unk> they get <unk> and worse even for the time that it takes to come to their destiny, which is where it's most important: <unk>
These are regions of the body like the <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily enter the blood flow of the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the drugs that are now a <unk> treatment for a life <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to make the treatment directly to the <unk> virus, without the risk of <unk> from the <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for wounds and surgery and diabetes surgery can be used for anything <unk> including the drug transportation of medicines.
In fact, we are using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes. It opens up and close the cells that are infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
And the best people are asked, "What is that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful laser ray over the membrane cell living with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser cuts the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or plate plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a device of three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, he runs to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that <unk> the drug releases it directly at the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem very much about time.
But one day, if it succeed, this technology can lead to the total of HIV in the body.
Yes. <unk>
This is the dream of the whole researcher of <unk> in our case, a laser.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups not <unk> <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent violence to violent confrontation for violent <unk>
I do work work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-governmental actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any resolution of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well for the reasons why they do it, but nobody analyzes what do you do when you don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the politics are not armed with <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just fire.
They're multitasking actually.
It <unk> a complex complex machine, radio stations and TV channels and online websites and social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> in English and published to <unk>
<unk> are also investing in a complex fundraising without <unk> but by doing business <unk> for example, building construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit and build their brand.
<unk> also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals, they put in professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups also try to conquer the population offering something that the state of no security and protection.
The ascent of Taliban in an Afghanistan torn out of the war or even the beginning of the <unk> <unk> can be understood by the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price of high school for the population.
But in general, providing social services means <unk> a <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral election of 2006 of <unk> cannot be understood without recognizing the social work.
It's a really complex scenario, even in the West, when we look at the groups of <unk> we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid groups.
<unk> because they fill gaps spread through the government, and they emerge as groups and politicians, participate in nonviolent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated ones are these organizations, less we can <unk> them as a opposite to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of a landscape, running all of its functions, collected the garbage, running the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of <unk> nations, and the weaker ones are states, as in the Middle East today, more to come to fill that gap not government <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the military tools.
<unk> that government <unk> has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put peace together.
If you understand better than the groups -- we will understand better than incentives to offer the transition from violence to nonviolent violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors not <unk> military power can win some <unk> but we will not provide peace and stability.
To get these goals we need long-term investments to fill that vacuum void to fill that <unk> <unk> that allowed these groups to flourish in a principle.
Thank you.
I am a <unk> as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the label <unk> it would be unfair to the <unk>
I'm a <unk> but quite bad.
And therefore I <unk> myself as a bad feminist.
Or at least I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and at 20 years, I had weird ideas about the <unk> these women were <unk> with the men and that they <unk> as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are being treated around the world and anger, in particular, it seems to be perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty word.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which begs too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and besides, I proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use in a very easy way, and it will be able to be able to be able to use the contraceptives and the <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account of our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> and skills and skills and much more.
We need to have to have these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I hear rap music <unk>
Even though the letter degrades the women and it offends me, the classic <unk> of the world: <unk> <unk> is incredible.
<unk> reality with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you <unk> the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical experience.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> maintenance and <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> the fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> fairy tales that come true.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's her choice, and I'm not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their kids, I agreed that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's play this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, and gay workers, gay workers, and <unk> for white women and high class.
Listen, if that's good anger -- I'm a very bad feminist issue.
It also happens to the following: <unk> <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to <unk> <unk> <unk>
We hope that it will be <unk>
When we have <unk> <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself to <unk> that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yeah, I'm a fear of fear of what that works is for fear of not being able to fulfill the little expectations of realistic.
Take an example to <unk> or like I call it.
In the last few years it's a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a show of <unk> to see this star star embracing Feminism and <unk> to the women and the young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics began endless debates if <unk> was not exactly a feminist.
He would take their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult and <unk> woman.
<unk> perfection -- because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot, we need a lot of <unk>
We're going far beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> affection for any woman, <unk> until there is nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminism, or more good, <unk> feminism is about <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the <unk> to the action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I hear music music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until <unk> change affecting their profits.
It's certainly difficult.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to pick up something better and so easy to justify a better choice.
But when the bad decisions get justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three-year-old <unk>
It's two <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
Because of the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We can change the <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to film on another part when movies are not dealing with women than like <unk>
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes treat their classmates as <unk>
In any case, men, especially the white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post on your journal, to participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate in how to be making decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization will be more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they are going to engage in this kind of projects, we can also afford to become even even more like us being <unk> to overcome barriers to the decision <unk>
Because we are not <unk> no embrace of these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to the people in the power and film producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also claim to bravery our feminism, -- good, bad, or from any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to be <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I mean it above all, because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A few boys were excited when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I <unk> my voice, and after I did not bother to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, also found that if I was a little brave, another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to get anything.
And in the other, I hold the <unk> fact that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we could all be a little courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had been <unk> to have visited <unk> or being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went across the border to Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> which may be terrible for a child with an immune system is one of the most impossible diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, was not the article that sparked argument about autism and vaccines and vaccines and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all around the world keep <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very weird disease.
And the few psychologists and realize that I'd heard about her believed to develop all their professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, estimates of prevalence continued to only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of fundraising as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control on Atlanta what is happening, they tend to be based on sentences as <unk> of diagnostic <unk> and a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who looks for the face of his son of two years old, the visual contact.
If the diagnosis criteria had to be <unk> why they were so <unk>
Why were the case of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> in science that with the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a powerful impact on global public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital -- in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds and private, <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
You could fun for hours by waving your faces, but they were prey to panic for <unk> like when you didn't put his favorite toy in your usual place without knowing it.
On the basis of the patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the 1950s, as the leading authority in the world in the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome while we were able to references to places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis was very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was convinced that he had converted to nine out of 10 children sent to their office to their office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a <unk> way by cold parents, <unk>
These kids said, they have kept very carefully in a fridge that we don't know.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special abilities that cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I get the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records -- he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the kids were just <unk> what they had heard their parents <unk> desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers -- was pretty <unk>
She and her husband John was warm and warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter.
<unk> and John knew how difficult it was to raise a little girl and no support services, no special education, no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
He <unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find children autistic in the community.
What you saw was that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse.
Some children couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination for the astrophysics, in the dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
Otherwise, these children didn't fit into beautiful <unk> and <unk> as he said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
Early on, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How did nobody ever realized these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article in <unk> and then he <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article from the competition, but I avoided <unk> on their own work.
There was not even an English translation -- but luckily, the husband of <unk> was a German man, and he <unk> it for her.
The document provides an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a <unk> clinic in Vienna, in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for child teaching children were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with computer exercises with music, and kids follow their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism causing a <unk> disability, in a life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces over the course of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients as patients as patients called them their little teachers, and he devoted to help the development of education methods that were especially suited for them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a diverse continuum that included a surprising variety of gifts, gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and the traits are common, and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in pop culture as a awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, well for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that would reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late 1980s, and the early '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad and <unk>
These changes don't fell in <unk> <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked on the <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I went out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> recognition of <unk> <unk> <unk> and parents around the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical trials to be introduced to diagnose autism.
I should not have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the awareness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they expected me to be out of it, and they were hoping that the people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines by the rise of <unk> a powerful <unk> and <unk> credible story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of prevention that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, they're right in the spectrum, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
Over the past few years, people are joined by the Internet to refuse the idea that the puzzles are to solve for new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and suffers from a deficit deficit to detail.
<unk> people autistic have a hard time to live in a world that's not built for them.
70 years later, we are still reaching <unk> which creates the <unk> for the <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding the teachers, employers with capacity, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we <unk> into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
